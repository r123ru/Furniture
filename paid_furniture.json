It\u2019s an excellent enhancement for diversifying your home decoration options. All the furniture pieces are solid 3D blocks, allowing you to rotate and place them in any orientation effortlessly. Certain items, like chairs and sofas, come with added functionality \u2013 you can actually sit on them. All the furniture can be crafted using the new Furnicraft Bench. Crafting Recipes: First, you will have to obtain the clay for the furniture, its elaboration is the following: When you have furniture clay, you will have to go to the furniture bench. Here is an example of how the furniture is obtained on the furniture bench: and with that done you can get all the furniture in survival.

For the content creator NPCs, they are tamed with 1 diamond and they will follow you and attack the enemy mobs, and even with a lock, you can make them stay still. NPCs are found in the villages. Here is an example of how the NPC inventory looks: How to get the ring? You will need to get the rose gold ore which can be found in mines or caves all over the world. Its probability of appearing is average But if you go to a town below them you can find a lot of rose gold ore. With the Caves update, you can now also find rose gold in the depths, it can appear from layer -56 to layer 60 approximately. Here is an example of how the ring is crafted: How to get the tools?

Orc ringleader Located in the Extreme Hills, Savanna, and Dessert Biomes, these spawn with 2 more Orc warriors covering them, WAAAGHH! Orc warrior They spawn with the orc ringleader, they are very dangerous. Nekros Colossus An abomination of Bones that came to \u201clife\u201d they are considered as mini-bosses, so, be very careful when you find one in the darkest caves of Minecraft. Ochi Nekros Similar to the Nekros Colossus, they spawn in caves. Ghost They use to spawn in the overworld when the night arrives, very spooky creatures that will be very happy to see you running and screaming while they chase you. Juggernaut A monster made out of flesh and blood, spawns in the deepest caves by the moment. Nether Boss This creature is in a Beta state, isn\u2019t finished, and presents A LOT of bugs, will not spawn in your survival worlds. Satirimus \u2013 The Final Legend This creature is in a Beta state, isn\u2019t finished, and presents A LOT of bugs, will not spawn in your survival worlds. Ebony gear The ebony is a new ore you\u2019ll be able to find in the deepest caves, is stronger than the netherite but harder to find. Totems There are just 2 totems in this version, the healing and protection totems, but the second one cannot be obtained in survival, to get the totems you need to \u201cdecraft\u201d the totems of undying and then combine the empty totem with some elements: Necromancy Table and Magical Objects Table: Here you\u2019ll be able to craft some cool stuff related to the necromancy, such as conjuration books and totems (exclusive for the Magical Objects Table) Tomes Make sure you activated the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Do you want to be in a world where everything is unpredictable and makes no sense? Then this addon is perfect for you. Randomized Everything Addon (1.19) comes with 3,625 RANDOMIZED FILES, randomly altering entities, loot tables, textures, colors, and much more. Imagine playing Minecraft where every time you log in, you experience something new and unexpected. With this addon installed, you and your friends can have a time of your life with the randomization of at least one aspect from every category in the Minecraft code, with the promise of even more randomization in the future. This addon doesn\u2019t provide complete randomization, as that would result in a visually unappealing and unenjoyable gaming experience. Instead, certain categories are randomized within their respective groups, such as all wood types in one category and all ores in another. Not every aspect of each category will be randomized, but with time, the aim is to include more random elements while still maintaining a polished and enjoyable game. The priority is to provide a fun and polished gaming experience, so please be patient as the addon continues to improve and become more randomized. Below is an example of not putting files in categories: How many files are randomized: 3,625 files are randomized 5,000-6,000 total things randomized Entities Behavior pack: Projectiles Boats Minecarts Fishes Squids Slimes Other entities ETC.

Seeds and changing Seeds What are seeds: Seeds hold a combination of random attributes with the addon Each seed has a different combination of random attributes, allowing you to pick the randomized combination you want to play with and makes it so you don\u2019t have to play the same randomizer over and over again. Both the resource pack and behavior pack consist of 23 seeds. You do not have to use both the resource pack and the behavior pack be on the same seed. You could have the behavior pack on seed 7, the resource pack can be on seed 18. Required experimental features must be enabled for the addon to work properly. 25 Seed Packs: \u2013",

            "description": "6th Century Addon (1.20, 1.19) includes many new types of dragons that will live in the open spaces of Minecraft Bedrock. In addition, several types of armor will appear so that the player can resist such powerful creatures. 6th Century is a Mod created by Kyuu Desperation to recreate a Classified File from the Britannia Government of the 7th World. Such information for him to access is unknown, but Yu stated that he uses Anticipation, and his Dreams (which is weird) to find pieces and clues for the Classified Information. 6th Century is a Series where a long-dead Sceptre named Anthony Concord was assigned by the Lordships, Virtues, and Authorities to stop an \u201cUnexplainable\u201d Event and Mysterious Activities in the 6th Century AD. After his descent to 7645 years in the past, he must find the source of \u201cThe Event\u201d and stop it. Little did he know, he must continue the rest of 100 years up until the beginning of the next Century. As \u201cThe Event\u201d was only part of \u201cThe Catastrophe\u201d.

Warden can detect vibrations and sounds of a helicopter but does not get agitated (for some reason). Basic Facts: This Helicopter is similar to your world\u2019s Mosquito Helicopters, though some parts are noticeably different. One example of the difference is Seat Capacity, most of your world\u2019s Mosquito Helicopters have only 1 Seat which is for the Pilot. Ermanaric A1 has 2 seats cause instead of having its purpose being just a Personal Helicopter (which fun fact you can get in America for the minimum of $2K), it is also used by the Germanics (Imperial Germans) as a Scout Helicopter to use whilst Trench Warfare was still manageable in the 2nd Great War. Operating System: Starting Helicopter: A helicopter can be started or Stopped if the Rider is riding it and the Helicopter is on the ground. You can only stop its engine and the whole helicopter itself on the ground as this avoids the sudden death of falling from the sky. When Aboard the Helicopter, you can turn on its power and engine to start. But it can take a maximum of 25 Seconds until you can fly. Flight Controls: You can change the helicopter\u2019s Altitude by looking up or down. You can also make the helicopter stay on its current Altitude by wearing a special type of head equipment. Head Item Controller: 7th World Helicopter Pilot Helmet. This Flight Altitude Stabilizer is only available for Machines and the Flying Animal, Hippogriff. Recommended: It is recommended that only the Pilot shall wear the Item controller. Visual Animations: Main Rotors: Main Rotors when helicopter is going up has its Main Rotors tilt 30+ degrees. Main Rotors will return to 0 degrees if helicopter is going down. Lights: Lights will start blinking on the Tail Boom, cockpit, and Cabin. Tail Rotors: It spins faster than the main Rotors. Cyclic: Cyclic moves forward, and sideways, just like how real helicopters are operated. All Rotors: All Rotors Spin so fast that you can visually see it is spinning in the Opposite Direction. Whole Helicopter: It Tilts a little when it goes Forward, or sideways movements. Cockpit: Buttons for certain Actions can light up to darken, and some lights show the Engine, Fuel, Health, and States of the Helicopter. Dracan Eggs The normal and virgin ones are the same.

If it\u2019s in Water, not on the ground, or the light level is below 11, the egg will not hatch and the Time will reset. Virgin Eggs: These Eggs are found on Dracans that you killed, as they have carried eggs inside them. But they don\u2019t have a mate right? Indeed they don\u2019t, as the mother created these Virgin Eggs had undergone Parthenogenesis.

These structures, which are taken from the main addon called Dungeon Raiders, range in size and design, including small ruins, ruined houses, and battle towers. Each structure is unique and has been carefully crafted with attention to detail. They can be found in all biomes and contain loot such as pots and crates.

            "description": "Better Adventures Expansion Addon (1.20, 1.19) aims to diversify the game\u2019s world and make it less repetitive, this addon introduces new biomes, variations to vanilla biomes, new cultures and people, structures, ruins, fixed structures, animals, and even new bosses. The focus is not on realism but on fantasy, with many magical items and creatures capable of performing magic. The Better Adventures Mod is a massive project that aims to diversify Minecraft by adding many more biomes and biome variants, along with new trees, blocks, ores, mobs, and even new cultures. It also reworks many of Minecraft\u2019s basic features, such as Villagers, to provide a fresh new experience. However, due to the aforementioned bug, the new full version of the add-on can\u2019t be released until the bug gets resolved, as a vast quantity of the mod\u2019s content relies on custom biomes. Until then, the developers will be posting betas leading to the full release. Please note that this mod is mainly about exploration, and this page only covers the basics of the add-on. For a more detailed understanding, you are encouraged to read the sections containing information on new features added with every update. The mod is compatible with Minecraft versions up to 1.17.40 and the current newest version, but due to a bug (MCPE-100700), custom biomes do not generate in versions 1.18 or higher. This issue has led to the mod being split into two versions: the Full version and the Beta version. The Full version works on MC versions up to 1.17.40, while the Beta versions have all the new features and work on the current newest version of Minecraft. Full version: Beta version:",

The add-on aims to make the game more challenging and immersive, by introducing new mobs, items, biomes, structures, and mechanics. New mobs : The add-on adds four new hostile mobs that will spawn in different biomes and situations. These are the Gloomy Zombie, the Gloomy Skeleton, the Gloomy Creeper, and the Gloomy Spider. These mobs have different abilities and behaviors than their normal counterparts, such as being faster, stronger, smarter, or more explosive. They also have a dark and gloomy appearance, with glowing eyes and particles. New items : The add-on also adds two new items that can be obtained from the new mobs. These are the Gloomy Bone and the Gloomy Gunpowder. These items can be used to craft new weapons and tools, such as the Gloomy Sword, the Gloomy Bow, the Gloomy Arrow, and the Gloomy TNT. These weapons and tools have special effects and advantages over their normal versions, such as dealing more damage, having longer ranges, or causing bigger explosions. New biomes : The add-on also modifies some of the existing biomes in the game, making them more gloomy and spooky. These are the Gloomy Forest, the Gloomy Swamp, the Gloomy Desert, and the Gloomy Plains. These biomes have different colors, vegetation, structures, and sounds than their normal versions, creating a more eerie and mysterious atmosphere. They also have a higher chance of spawning new mobs, making them more dangerous to explore. New structure s: The add-on also adds some new structures that can be found in the modified biomes. These are the Gloomy Mansion, the Gloomy Temple, the Gloomy Pyramid, and the Gloomy Village. These structures have different designs, loot, traps, and secrets than their normal versions, offering more rewards and challenges for adventurous players. They also have a higher chance of spawning new mobs, making them more risky to enter. New mechanics : The add-on also changes some of the existing mechanics in the game, making them more realistic and immersive. These are the Day-Night Cycle, the Weather System, the Lighting System, and the Sound System. These mechanics have different effects and impacts on the gameplay than their normal versions, such as making the nights longer and darker, making the weather more unpredictable and dynamic, making the lighting more realistic and dramatic, and making the sound more immersive and directional. The Minecraft Gloomy Update Mini Add-on is a great way to spice up your Minecraft world with some horror and mystery. It is compatible with both Minecraft Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Java Edition, and it can be downloaded from this link. The add-on is easy to install and use, and it does not require any additional mods or resource packs.

If you are looking for a new challenge and adventure in your Minecraft world, then you should definitely try out the Minecraft Gloomy Update Mini Add-on. It will make your game more fun and exciting, but also more scary and creepy. Are you brave enough to face the gloom? Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013 Zip: \u2013",

            "author": "BATBOA",
            "description": "Ragnarok Addon (1.20, 1.19) is an addon inspired by God of War: Ragnarok and they intend to make a universe with this addon, with the goal of eventually implementing the entire God of War universe in Minecraft. The intention of this addon is to make players feel like a God of War. The addon is designed for survival and cooperative play, and it is hoped that you will enjoy it with your friends. The intention is also to change the way of playing Minecraft, altering the gameplay and difficulty of the game, so it is hoped that you will have fun with the Ragnarok addon and appreciate this project that is being made with love. The Ragnarok addon includes weapons, armor, mobs, trades, and a combat system, all designed to give players the atmosphere of being in the God of War universe. The addon items are mainly used for the creation of weapons, armor and you can even trade with them, the items are difficult to obtain since the weapons are very powerful as well as the armor Will you be able to get all the armor and level up the weapons to the maximum level? Will you be worthy of being the\u00a0god of war? Solid Mercury: Uru: Beryllium red: Fog Echo: Jormungand Essence: Jormungand Venom: Asgardian Steel: Svartalfheim Steel: Hardened Steel: Draupnir Ring: Draupnir Blade: Chaos Flame: Frozen flame: Gale flame: Lightning essence: OMEGA (This item is used to create a launchable leviathan): Thor\u2019s gauntlets (this item is used to create a throwable Mjolnir): The addon has more than 50 armors and some armors are easy to get, but others are difficult to get because they give you unimaginable resistance and also give effects, in addition to adding a multiplayer function, in which some armors like\u00a0Zeus\u2019s\u00a0breastplate has the ability to give the same effect to the players you have in a nearby radius, can you forge an armor worthy of a god of war? All the armors are designed for you to create your own combination, so design your powerful armor of the god of war. The strongest armor sets are: 1st Armor of Zeus 2nd Armor of Ares 3rd Steinbjorn Armor \u2026 There are also full body armors that serve more than anything to give an atmosphere to the addon and you sit in the god of war universe, and you decide who you want to be (These armors also give you effects related to the powers they have in God of War Ragnarok) And finally add the reference armors, which also give you effects and even some also give effects to more players close to you, these armors are inspired by the moon knight, namor or kukulkan, and thanos or the titan. These armors are also designed for you to design your appearance and make the best armor to be the most powerful god of war *All armor crafts are on the crafting table and remember that you can design your outfit yourself! Each weapon has two special attacks and two unique animations, and the addon has more than 20 animations and unique attacks Leviathan Leviathan has 6 levels, leviathan, level 3 leviathan and level 6 leviathan, each time leviathan levels up it is much stronger and its special attack is even more destructive, all attacks and special attacks were inspired by god of war ragnarok and god of war 2018. In addition, the author also added a launchable leviathan that is obtained for free by improving leviathan to level 6. To upgrade to leviathan lvl3: To upgrade to leviathan lvl6: When throwing leviathan there is a chance that it will be lost and in case it is lost you must use OMEGA for another throwable leviathan Mj\u00f6lnir Mj\u00f6lnir has the ability to make you fly and at the same time serves as the transportation and has the ability to summon lightning and launch them at mobs close to you, in addition to crafting it, it will also give you launchable Mj\u00f6lnir and launchable Mj\u00f6lnir on impact will generate lightning, but there is also a small chance of it being lost and to craft another throwable Mj\u00f6lnir you need thor\u2019s gauntlets Blades of Chaos The blades of chaos have 5 levels, being that there are the blades of chaos base, the blades of chaos of level 3, and the blades of chaos of level 5, these swords have attacks and special attacks inspired by god of war ragnarok and god of war 2018. Also add the hook-shaped blades of chaos, which serve as transportation They also added the chains and claws of Hades, these weapons are the easiest to get and have two levels: the claws of Hades and the chains of Hades. The chains of Hades are much more powerful than the claws of Hades and have a special attack, while the Hades claws have only a special attack. Draupnir Spear Draupnir Spear has 9 levels, being that we will have draupnir spear base, draupnir spear lvl6 and draupnir spear lvl9, each one has a different attack and a special attack, you can get them yourself and try them, but all of them attacks and special attacks were inspired by god of war ragnarok, hope you enjoy draupnir spear and feel like a god of war. Fury, Wrath, and Valor The spartan furies are totems that the author implemented with the intention that you can use the spartan fury just like in god of war Ragnarok but when using any fury you will have a very high cooldown since they are very powerful items VALOR regenerates you for life Wrath gives you incredible strength to amplify the damage you do with your weapon, he also gives you super speed and super jump for a very short time Fury gives you very high speed and enormous strength with which you can destroy many things * All weapons can be repaired and enchanted, other than if you have a diamond sword or netherite with enchantments you can pass them to any weapon in this addon. In the combat update, the author made each weapon have a combo, for example, leviathan has a combo at 15 hits, and when the 15 hits are completed you will make an attack, which is completely independent of the special attack. The intention of the combat update is to change the gameplay of Minecraft so that you feel in the god of war universe and you can create your attacks yourself. Each weapon has its combo and its unique attack independent of the special attack, in addition to showing in the name of the weapon how many hits you need to give to start the combo. Higher-level weapons will have a more powerful combo independent of the special attack which is also very powerful for higher-level weapons. With the new combat, you can create your own combos by combining the special attacks or attacks of your weapons, the question is, will you be as strong as Kratos? Hope you like this update designed for combat and cooperation, since when you perform some combos you will add effects to the players near you, as well as some armor that also gives effects to players near you. Sindri and Brok are the huldra brothers who are there to help you improve weapons and even trade items for the creation of your armor, they will appear around the world, but the only place where they appear together is the snow plains Brok: Sindri: The draugr are dead returned to life that will make your life more difficult, and there are several types of draugr, being that the normal draugr will only burn you with the effect of wither, while the projectile draugr will attack you from a distance by throwing fireballs at you and when it is close it will run to attack you, the explosive draugr will explode as well as the creepers when it is close to you, but the explosive draugr will make an explosion that will generate fire and do more damage, so be very careful, and lastly the empowered draugr They are bigger draugr that carry a sword that, in addition to impressing you with the effect of wither, will do you a very high damage, but once you have a good team they will not be an obstacle for you. Draugr: Draugr proyectil: Explosive Draugr: Empowered Draugr: The troll is a boss that has 1850 life and will not be generated throughout the world, only in the dungeons, when they die they will drop the dream stone that is used to craft Steinbjor\u2019s armor, in addition to the fact that the troll will make lethal attacks, so you must be very careful, but with the correct equipment, they will not be an impediment for you. As a curious fact in God of War of Norse mythology, the troll measures 14m while Kratos is 1.9, being that the troll is practically 7 times bigger than Kratos, but in order not to give lag problems, the troll is 3.5 times bigger than Steve. The structures will appear throughout the world, the nether and the end, but you must be very attentive to them, since they have many materials that will make your life easier and you can have better equipment, so let the TIME begin ADVENTURE Sindri shop: Brok shop: Dungeons are very difficult fortresses, so you should go when you have good equipment that in the end you will have to face one or two trolls, but the rewards will be very good, so it will be worth it. Show them who is the god of war: Dungeon of a troll: Dungeon of two trolls: The geometry of the trident was changed to resemble leviathan and it was also added that upon impact it invokes lightning, without the need for it to be enchanted, the geometry of the shield was also modified to be the same as that of god of war 2018. It also implemented that when having the weapons in the inventory they appear on the back, in the same position that Kratos has them in God of war and it works with the blade of cahos, leviathan, the chains of Hades, the shield and the trident. Notice that you do not see the customized or created skins in Minecraft, you only see the skins from the marketplace. If you want your skin and your friends to be seen, download the \u201cRagnarok Skin Pack\u201d. Make sure you activated all the following \u201cExperimental Settings\u201d: Ragnarok Addon: \u2013 Ragnarok Addon for Realms: \u2013 Skin Pack: \u2013 Ragnarok Addon:",

In addition, there will be new structures and biomes that are naturally generated.

Therefore, Radioactive Craft Addon (1.20, 1.19) added it to Minecraft with 6 Radioactive Ores and 1 non-radioactive Ore in total! And new machines and Items with them! (This Addon doesn\u2019t add too many Machines, this is because more will be added in another future addon of the author\u2019s.) The Guide book you will get when joining a new world. When interacting on it with any Machines of the Addon, it will say a guide on how to use it. This is why the author only will give a small Description of Items and Blocks. Or just sneak and interact so it explains the Radiation System. Examples: This addon adds 7 New ores! Strontium The only not Radioactive Ore in this addon! It protects the player against Radiation Berkelium The Least Radioactive Ore in the Addon Thorium Not that radioactive compared to the other ores Uranium It\u2019s the between the Radioactive elements Radium It\u2019s an Alloy out of Thorium and Uranium Neptunium Neptunium is one of the more Radioactive Ores and has a lot of uses Plutonium Plutonium is the most Radioactive Element Gaiger Counter The first item is a Gaiger Counter when interacted will tell you the amount of Radiation you have Documentary Pieces 4 In total, those are only found in a structure and only have a bit of lore in them Disk \u201cRadioactive Disaster\u201d This Disk is found in the form of Fragments and also has lore in it Potion of cure This Potion is made out of Radium and will cure anything Radioactive Core Radioactive Core is used for Replacement for Crafting and as a power in some machines Radioactive Container The Radioactive Container can store an unlimited amount of Radioactive Elements/things Pipes R.A.M, Gas pipes, and Heat Pipes are the main Pipes in this Addon Heat Exchanger This is the Main Generator in this addon. It is compatible with RF from\u00a0Advanced Machinery Heat Storage and Destroyer Those are fairly simple, the one Destroys Heat and the Other Stores it Element Compressor It will make nuggets for Ingots and Ingots to Blocks Radioactive Compressor Has a chance of turning stone/Deepslate into Radioactive Ores Radioactive \u00a0Converter This Machine Turns Elements into other Elements Radioactive Storage Pretty self-explaining, ain\u2019t it? Gas Mixer It will Mix Gasses together to create new things Hydrogen, Fluorine, Chlorine, and Oxygen Extractor They Extract the Gasses out of the air The Only Structure is an abandoned Laboratory that spawns below Y = 0 And that is about it!

It is often used in popular modpack like RLCraft and Hexxit. So the author has decided to create an addon version of this mod, which will be very exciting. Ruins Addon (1.20, 1.19) spawns Structures in your Minecraft worlds, similar to Villages and Strongholds. This addon brings a sense of endless adventure to Minecraft by introducing lots of randomly generated structures, including houses, temples, and even castles in the sky.

            "name": "Yokai \u2013 Chapter One Addon",
            "author": "ItsDarkwolf6",
            "description": "Yokai \u2013 Chapter One Addon (1.20) introduces resonant elements inspired by the Shinto heritage of Japan into your Minecraft World. It contains distinct structures, items, and entities that mirror the mystical allure of Yokai folklore. Get ready to unleash a horde of spooky monsters into your world. This addon is divided into different chapters, each focusing on different amounts and themes of Yokai. In each chapter, a biome will be transformed into a creepy landscape where these creatures, structures, and items will morph your playthrough into a whole new experience. Note: This addon is in its early stages and may contain bugs or not work as intended. In this chapter, the spotlight is cast upon two iconic yokai entities, deeply entrenched in Yokai mythology: the Kuchisake-Onna, renowned as the \u201cSlit-Mouth Woman,\u201d and the Onry\u014d, a formidable manifestation of vengeful spirits. This chapter introduces the discovery of abandoned villages, vigilantly protected by Onry\u014d, while also adding talismans, to protect the player from these two evil spirits. This chapter will not include anything huge, think of it as setting up a story. You want to start off small, then end big. That\u2019s why this chapter is called \u201cPrologue.\u201d Onry\u014d The Onry\u014d (literally meaning \u201cvengeful spirit\u201d) is a spirit deeply rooted in Japanese folklore and mythology. It is believed to be the restless soul of an individual who has suffered a grievous injustice or tragedy during their lifetime. Driven by intense feelings of anger, sorrow, or resentment, the Onry\u014d seeks to exact vengeance upon the living, often through supernatural and eerie manifestations that serve as a chilling reminder of their unresolved grievances. In this addon, Onry\u014d can spawn near-abandoned villages, protecting the homes that they died in and inflicting a curse upon anyone who dares to step near it. Notably, the lanterns illuminating the abandoned houses emit an unusual blue flame. Spirits tend to manifest inside these lanterns, and as more spirits inhabit these lanterns, they gradually spill out, haunting their surroundings. Abilities: The Onry\u014d possesses a unique ability against the item used to ward off evil spirits. When a player is holding a talisman while being pursued by the Onry\u014d, the talisman burns in their hand and will be rendered useless afterward. The Onry\u014d emits audible cues that intensify as one draws nearer.\u00a0 The Onry\u014d will pursue the player until either their escape or the talisman wards them off. The Onry\u014d has a \u201cblinking period,\u201d where if you played The Mimic on ROBLOX, it is fairly similar to that. The Onry\u014d can temporarily appear and disappear, similarly to Mihari and Shinigami. (We know most of you downloading this are huge The Mimic fans. Stop asking for Craftkai, it will come out in 100 years) Kuchisake-Onna Kuchisake-Onna, (Commonly known as the \u201cSlit-Mouthed Woman\u201d) is an entity woven into Japanese urban legends. Her origin traces back to feudal Japan, where she was once a beautiful woman disfigured by a vengeful samurai. Concealing her split mouth beneath a mask, she haunts alleyways and dark corners, posing an unsettling question to unsuspecting passersby about her appearance. In this addon, Kuchisake-Onna spawns near the outskirts of the abandoned villages and will appear without her mask on. She wields razor-sharp scissors and will pursue the player until three things happen, which deal with her weaknesses. Abilities: Kuchisake-Onna is extremely fast, and once she detects you, there is no running from her. She does not have many other unique abilities, but just know to be careful when you\u2019re investigating your world, she might be chasing you down and you won\u2019t know it. Kuchisake-Onna is capable of ignoring talismans completely when in pursuit of you. Sorry, but those seals won\u2019t save you from her! Weaknesses: The player is capable of making a mirror. When holding the mirror, Kuchisake-Onna will slow down, as she is confused about her own appearance. Right-click her with the mirror, and she will be stunned. Do this for a count of three times, and Kuchisake-Onna will be killed. (When you kill her, all Kuchisake-Onnas will die, so you don\u2019t have to worry about running into her again for a while!) Talisman A talisman, rooted in Japanese Shinto beliefs, is an imbued object believed to possess spiritual or protective powers. These objects are often inscribed with symbols, prayers, or characters to channel specific energies or ward off malevolent forces. These talismans are carried or hung in various locations, such as on bags or in cars, to ensure the wearer\u2019s well-being, safety, and good fortune. In this addon, a talisman will offer the player protection from evil spirits and will help you get away from the spirits that are chasing after you. The talisman can be found in some houses of abandoned villages, but they will not be so easy to find. To increase your chances of finding a talisman, you can search shrines which will guarantee your chances of finding one. Weaknesses: Kuchisake-Onna remains unaffected by the protective properties of the talisman, while the talisman\u2019s efficacy diminishes after a single use upon the approach of an Onry\u014d within its effective range. Protect: This will ward off evil spirits. Whenever the player right-clicks the ground with this talisman, the spirits will run away from you. Banish: This is the second talisman you can find, that will banish any spirits near you. When you right-click while holding the talisman, any spirit within the area will automatically disappear. Crates In this addon, you can find crates in abandoned homes, or in a shrine. The old crates will usually drop junk on the floor, and will sometimes drop a talisman if lucky enough. In the image above, there are two types of crates. Old Crates: As stated before, old crates may drop junk, and they also may drop an occasional talisman. This crate is all about luck and searching through some homes to see if any of the crates provided to you will give you what you need, Marked Old Crate: A marked old crate will guarantee the player obtaining a talisman. Although, it also has a chance of getting the attention of Kuchisake-Onna, but the chances are below 50%. When looking through marked old crates, be prepared just in case she comes to attack. Mirror The mirror serves as a craftable item for players to shield themselves from Kuchisake-Onna. When the mirror is employed against her, it shatters, and the player needs to use glass in order to repair it. In the act of using the mirror, Kuchisake-Onna\u2019s anger intensifies, but she is momentarily stunned as she is enraged. During this brief pause, players can either attempt to escape or repair the mirror. Materials needed to craft the mirror: How to repair the mirror. (You could also do this in your inventory): Music Box The music box can also be created by the player through crafting. To manufacture a music box, the player is required to collect fragments of the music box, which are obtainable from old crates. Once the music box is in hand, winding it up and setting it down is the next step. Activating the music box serves as a means to divert the attention of the Onry\u014d. During the time of distraction caused by the music box\u2019s melodies, the player gains a precious few seconds to effect their escape. Abandoned Village You will come across deserted villages plagued by the presence of Onry\u014d. In these locations, you\u2019ll also encounter crates, as previously mentioned, containing talismans that offer protection against the vengeful spirits\u2019 anger. Be careful as you explore these villages, for the Onry\u014d can manifest unexpectedly from any corner they choose. Abandoned Shrine A shrine is a sacred place where Kami, the spirits or deities revered in Shinto, are enshrined and worshipped. Rituals, prayers, and offerings are made at these shrines to seek blessings, protection, and guidance from the Kami. Shinto shrines play a central role in Japanese spiritual and cultural life, and they are often visited during important life events and festivals. In your world, sometimes, you might stumble upon shrines, though it\u2019s pretty rare. If you find a shrine, you\u2019ll find a marked old crate. That crate is your ticket to getting a guaranteed talisman. You\u2019ll always find marked crates right in the middle of the shrine. Though, be wary of the possibility that Kuchisake-Onna or the Onry\u014d will be around. Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Do you desire a fresh Minecraft portal or a new dimension? Perhaps even a new realm? If so, then you\u2019re in luck! Divine Realm Addon (1.19) features an entire realm for your map, as well as new tools, armor, mobs, and a small boss fight. This addon starts with the Divine Portal Frame: Once you craft the Divine Portal Frame you will be able to make the portal to the divine realm. To complete the portal you will need a flint and steel and a Divine Pearl. NOTE: Please don\u2019t place the first divine portal frame above Y level 90, please only Y level <90, thank you for your understanding. In order for you to make the portal you will need to place the Divine Portal Frame in front of you and light it on fire 4 times with the flint and steel, doing this will make the rest of the portal frame appear in front of you, after that, you will need to place the Divine Pearl at both ends of the frame and the portal will open! (or you can just watch the video and see there how to activate the portal) Once you fully activated the portal then you will be ready to jump into it! After jumping in it you should wake up in a beautiful new place called The Divine Realm! Here you will have a brand new place to explore! First, you will be greeted by the Divine Foxes and Divine Axolotls and maybe even see a few rare Divine Phantoms flying around, don\u2019t worry those are not hostile mobs towards you, well the Divine Axolotls will become very aggressive if you punch them so better to leave them alone. The Divine Phantoms on the other hand are your friends, they will gather items for you, much like the Allay, but faster. You will also find a small village, this village is protected by the Divine Evoker, this is a redeemed Evoker that won\u2019t be hostile towards you unless you start attacking him or the villagers in his village. In the middle of the island, you should find a big temple, there you can start a mini-boss fight against the Divine Blaze, Divine Zombies, and some Divine Shulkers, your reward for winning is the Divine Sword, a sword that is much better than a Netherite Sword and will help you in the next boss fight, for clearing the entire temple you will also get the Divine Armor and the rest of the Divine Tools. You can also craft the Tools and Armor using the Divine Ingot, but it is very expensive, and you should not lose the free pair that you got in the temple after the small boss fight. Recipe Example for the Divine Tools: Recipe Example For the Divine Armor: The Divine Tools and Armor are better than Netherite but the addon also adds another set of tools, The Divine Wooden Tools, which are supposed to be as good as diamond tools. Recipe Example for the Divine Wooden Tools: This addon also adds two new types of wood (you can craft the Divine Wooden Tools with both types of Divine wood) you can also use this Wood to make planks, sticks, and a crafting table, or just use it as decorations. On the island, you should also find a fully completed end portal and nether portal, probably because the ancient builders that were living on the Divine island already visited both the end and the nether. Enable EXPERIMENTAL GAMEPLAY in your world options in order to use this addon! \u2013 \u2013",

            "author": "JuliusScizzor",
            "description": "Zombie Apocalypse Addon (1.20, 1.19) transports the map\u2019s essence into your worlds, prepare to battle against endless swarms of zombies, as you acquire weapons, utilities, abilities, or boosters at the Shop, or construct a fortress with your companions. Stay on the edge and survive in a world where Hordes can appear at any time. And to top it off, you can collect ammo by CHAINSAWING zombies! The addon also offers a custom UI, 3D Weapons, bespoke zombies, blocks, and much more! This addon brings the Map\u2019s experience into your world. If you are looking for the map, it is here: Zombie Apocalypse Map Slay zombies for Experience Levels, and use them to buy weapons, utility, or boosters to aid you in your survival in this apocalypse! Oh, and you can CHAINSAW zombies for ammo. This addon also has a custom music system. The music changes according to the time of day and the number of zombies. The World Host can always turn on / off the music. This addon features a Host system. The very first player to join a world with this addon active will be the World Host. All players will receive the following items when they first join the world: Full Iron Armour Chainsaw P250 Pistol Personal Menu The World Host will receive the following additional items: Host Menu Fix item Safehouse Ch\u00fcck Mover There can only be 1 safehouse in any world. Choose your location wisely! The safe house is a chest with supplies, a crafting table, and a furnace. The safehouse also contains Ch\u00fcck, the friendly shopkeeper. He will load the chunks around him and he cannot be removed. Right-click/tap the Highscore Block or the Stats Block to view the World Highscores or World Stats respectively New Safehouse \u2013 Stronghold It has many starter items, lava generators for fuel (using dripstone), and even a small potato farm on the roof! Oh, and it\u2019s no longer flammable. Old Safehouse (Now called \u201cShed\u201d) The old safehouse isn\u2019t deleted! The world host can still craft it using Spruce Planks and an Iron Block. You can view all the new custom recipes in the recipe book. Use Experience Levels to buy items! Some special items such as Boosters may cost different items such as Diamonds or Lapis Lazuli Blocks. Just simply right-click/tap & hold Ch\u00fcck to open up the shop menu! Here you can change some settings like Difficulty, Music, Hordes, Display, etc. You can access this menu anywhere. If it breaks try using the fix item. You can access this anywhere. Here you can see the Credits, look at your stats, as well as learn about every zombie type! The highlight of this addon! Chainsaw zombies to instantly kill them! Chainsawing drops ammo, just like in DOOM. Note that not all zombies can be chainsawed! But you can save up for a Chainsaw upgrade to be able to chainsaw Brutes too! The glitch effect is not included. Hordes have a random chance of spawning in your world. You can turn them on/off in the Host Settings menu. Hordes will ONLY spawn on players who have NO BLOCKS above their heads. So as long as you have a block somewhere above your head, you are safe from hordes. Hordes last 3 minutes or when all horde zombies are killed. Horde zombies have sparkle particles around them. Each zombie drops a certain amount of points when killed, the more points you get by the end of the horde, the more XP you earn from it. New: Now normal zombies will give 1 point instead of 0, making it easier to get more points and gain more levels in Hordes. You can combine an egg and a yellow dye to get the D\u00fcck Spawn Egg. A duck is already in the Safehouse so you might not need to craft the spawn egg. Now you can trade rotten flesh for food! As well as copper ingots for iron ingots. This would make your Minecraft Zombie Apocalypse adventures a little easier. You can craft a Zombie Totem and summon hordes at your own will! Wanna build a base or defend your stronghold, or wanna make a zombie map with this addon Now there are more blocks for you to play around with! Most of these blocks are craftable in Survival. Just refer to the recipe book in-game to see their recipes! You need 2 sticks and an iron block to craft the Tactical Shovel. It\u2019s important to have because you can use it to change the Metal Fence into a corner fence, but most importantly it is to\u00a0mine all the custom blocks in this addon! This is due to limitations in Minecraft Bedrock Edition making normal tools not work on custom blocks. Breaking, shooting, or right-clicking/tapping the Toxic Barrel will cause it to ignite in a big fiery explosion! It also poisons nearby mobs for a bit. There\u2019s a non-griefing version of this block that doesn\u2019t break any blocks Note that\u00a0Mob Griefing gamerule\u00a0has to be\u00a0ON\u00a0for the barrel to be able to\u00a0explode when shot. Please be careful with this block, as the particles could cause lag! Besides those zombies shown above in the Personal Menu section, there are 3 new zombie types in v1.1 \u2013 The Miner, Knight Jockey, and Cowboy Zombies. Want a Boss Fight? Johnny can summon zombies and even CHAINSAW YOU. the tables have turned. Be careful! Whenever Johnny has fallen, it has a chance of spawning his MUCH stronger brother, Bobby! Bobby does not have a 1 hit-kill ability, but he does wield an Oblivion, dealing 32 damage per shot! We recommend having Protection 4 Scarlet Armour fight bobby! There\u2019s still plenty to experience in this addon! Try it yourself! This addon requires a Block Geo Fixer for custom blocks to work properly. You must not be on beta, please do not pirate Minecraft. Use the latest non-beta version. Make sure you activated the Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013 Block Geo Fixer (Require) mcaddon: \u2013 Zombie Apocalypse Map",

            "description": "Land Claim Addon (1.20) provides a secure environment for your areas by preventing other players from breaking, placing, or interacting with blocks. Additionally, there will be no explosions in your area. This ensures that your area is safe from any potential theft or damage. How to get the item: 6 iron blocks and 1 flint How to create an area: First, in order to determine your addon, you can just hold the protection tool item in your hand and go to the beginning of the area and make sure that you set Shift, then press Right Click and particles will be placed and a message will be sent to the player informing him of the starting coordinates that he chose. The same thing also applies when you want to specify the end coordinates of the area and make sure The addon will make you set the start and end coordinates, but if you try to set other coordinates, it will prevent you, when you set the coordinates with this method it will automatically add the coordinates to the form and you can do it manually to. To see the boundaries of your area, and you are an admin, you can enter your area and hold shift, and the boundaries will appear to you as you see in the picture. However, if the player inside the region has no powers and is not an admin, the boundaries will be shown to him as soon as he moves. List of area: Here you can see all your areas, and when you click on one of them, it will show you the players who have permission to interact with this area, you can remove them if you want to, but you cannot remove yourself, and also the players to whom you gave permission will not be able to remove the owner of the area. Give access to the player: Here you can give permission to the players you want to interact with in your area, such as your friends or your partner at home. You can now give him the authority to interact with the area, such as breaking blocks, placing them, and interacting with them. All you need is to specify the area, and of course, only the areas that you created will appear to you, not the ones you have permission for, and so on. The second is that the player must be in the world. Choose the area and the player and click Submit, and you will have been able to give him permission. To remove him, go to your regions in the previous option and select the region. The players who have permission for that area will appear to you and remove him. Delete option: Here your area will appear and you can delete the region you want Admin panel To see the admin panel button you must have the admin tag use this command: /tag @s add admin #option 1 all areas: This option will show you all the protected areas that players have taken within the world or your server. When you choose one of these areas, it will show you some information about it, such as the owner of the area, its beginning and end, as well as the surface that this area takes, in addition to two options. The first will delete the area, for example, if it is an area inside the spawn or a vandalized area, then the admin has the right to delete it and he can also teleport to it through the option the second #option 2 clear all areas: This option will enable you to delete and clear all protected areas within the world or your server, and it is equivalent to restarting or resetting the addon. Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

            "name": "Rule Villages Addon",
            "author": "Anghelos92",
            "description": "Rule Villages Addon (1.20, 1.19) enhances villages by adding a village controller that collects 13 items from different villagers professions. However, using a controller also increases the chance of illager raids, which are more challenging. You can protect the village by hiring guards from the villagers. The items from the village can be further refined in blast furnaces, smokers, or brewing stands. This mod aims to balance the trades and items values, making it easier to obtain decorative blocks with the production chains, but not affecting the usefulness of other items. You can also mine with golems and use them as cannons against raids. Moreover, you have a new transport option with an improved mule and a tnt minecart that can load chunks and carry items by rail. Illager Threat: PILLAGERS: They have both a melee and a ranged attack mode, exactly like the village guards, and are more aggressive in initiating the attacks, especially at range. Like Vindicators, Ravagers, and Evokers now they are capable of destroying fence gates and breaking down wooden doors. ILLAGER PATROLS: Now they do not despawn, so the patrols around the world will keep increasing their numbers if you don\u2019t get rid of them, but they now spawn farther away from the player, less frequently, and killing a captain does not cause a bad omen effect. To have an actual siege/raid you need the village controller in a village. RAIDS: Now are much more dangerous, you are not safe behind walls\u2026as you can see from the pictures cobblestone has been placed to patch the holes from ravager shelling. -Ravagers have a ranged explosive attack in addition to the vanilla melee and roar attacks. Their ranged attacks also set fires for the explosion, often breaking through manned walls. -Every 1 minute they will launch a TNT VEX, that will search and explode near their targets, SO UNDERGROUND BASES ARE NOT SAFE, also hiding behind the walls is no more an option because they will keep launching TNT VEXes while the raid is still in progress and they are alive. -Vindicators, Pillagers, Evokers, and Witches that are part of the raid will also launch 1 TNT VEXes every 3 minutes, so you must kill them, even f they hide during the raid waves. DOUBLE RAIDS: As per version 1.20 you have 2 raids in a row, this is a vanilla Minecraft \u201cbug\u201d, that has been officially reported and awaiting an official fix: Village Guards: Villagers can now interact with an Iron block, if they are adults, to enlist them into the army and become Village guards. Guards now spawn instead of iron golems, when created by the villages, all the nitwits are enlisted in the army automatically. They are equipped with full iron armor and both a crossbow and an iron sword, they will switch between the two modes about the distance of the target. They are capable of swimming and breathing underwater, suffer no fall damage, and are easily controllable. They have 20 HP but also a passive regen. They target all monsters except endermen and phantoms. They target successful creepers. If tamed they attack anything that hurts the owner or is the target of the owner BUT THEY DO NOT target other guards or iron golems, nor other players, because they are neutral with all players. Players and other guards can\u2019t damage them, so in an intense fight, you can fight without worrying of hitting them. To discard them use a wooden hoe. INTERACTIONS: -After enlisting they are in \u201cPATROL MODE\u201d, when in this mode they roam inside the village, like the iron golem would, if they get far from the village they are forced to return. If in the wild in this mode and a village is nearby they will go to the village, otherwise they roam patrolling freely. In this mode, they have an iron helmet equipped. -Interacting sneaking with a torch while they are in \u201cPATROL MODE\u201d put them in \u201cSENTINEL MODE\u201d, in this case, they will hold their ground no matter what and are forced into the ranged attack with their crossbow, they will have a leather helmet equipped. Sneak interact to revert. \u2013 You can hire them, \u201ctaming\u201d them with an emerald block. When tamed they will accept MODE change, demobilization and despawn orders only from the owner, with all the benefits. They equip a shield to signal when are hired. \u2013 A hired guard can interact with a torch without sneaking to switch between \u201cPATROL MODE\u201d or \u201cSENTINEL MODE\u201d into \u201cFOLLOWING MODE\u201d. When following, the guard will equip a diamond helmet and will stay within 10 10-block radius from the owner, behaving like tamed wolves, but with a better following AI. -Leashing/Unleashing a guard also switches between \u201cPATROL MODE\u201d and \u201cSENTINEL MODE\u201d. -Interacting with an Iron Hoe will turn them back into a villager. -Interacting with a wooden Hoe will despawn them. -Interacting with baked potatoes or any cooked meat (except cooked chicken) will grant them 10 minutes of regeneration I. -Interacting with an iron ingot gives them strength 2 and resistance 1 for 10 minutes and resupply their armor if they break it. -Are tempted by torches, so if you hold one in your hand they will follow you closely ignoring everything else, useful for fine control when needed. Village Controller: Is a new entity, a block statue, which stays put where you place it. IT MUST BE INSIDE A VILLAGE otherwise will explode. When placed it searches for other village controllers inside a 70-block radius, if found it will explode, this is because only one village controller is allowed per small village. It is crafted from 6 copper blocks and 3 emerald blocks. Cannot be damaged by players or guards and has 1000 hp, it is neutral to any mobs so ignored in fights. But if the village falls, (all the villagers are killed or all beds destroyed), it will fall. To discard it use a wooden hoe. The village controller acts as a \u201cResource collection point\u201d for the village and will produce 13 vanilla products, one for each villager profession, placing the produce inside its inventory, that you can open. It has different textures to indicate when you are the owner, when it is chunkloading etc. Has the writing \u201cIN\u201d on top, indicating that it has also item hopper capabilities, so if you drop something on top or place a chest on top of it, it will siphon the content. If you place a hopper or use a minecart hopper below the controller, you can collect the resources and also sort them with your trusted vanilla sorting system. To have the produce you actually must have a relative profession in the village. I.e. Armorer produces raw iron, so if you have an armorer in the village, the controller will collect raw iron. Having more than one villager of the same profession doesn\u2019t increase the controller production for the relative item. SIEGE DANGER:\u00a0 while the village controller is in the village and also a player is in the village there is a small chance an Illager raid will start. Statistically, a siege will happen by chance every 18 Minecraft days. Before you can do any of the following interactions, you must \u201ctame\u201d the controller with a GOLD INGOT, because only the owner of the controller will be able to do the following interactions: INTERACTIONS: -Interacting with a gold block, a siege will start. -Interacting with a wooden hoe will despawn it, destroying it. -Interacting with an emerald block will start a siege immediately but will also grant 15 days of chunkloading capabilities to the statue, in a 4-chunk radius. So the village can continue to produce while you are away. Win the siege first though\u2026otherwise while the village is chunkloaded the enemies will continue to fight. After 15 Minecraft days of chunkloading the village controller will despawn. -Interacting with a single emerald, while the player has the effect hero of the village, will also grant 15 days of chunkloading capabilities in a 4-chunk radius removing the hero effect from the player. After 15 Minecraft days of chunk loading the village controller will despawn. -Interacting with a nether star will eliminate any siege danger chance for that particular controller, but it will not be able to chunkload. (Mutually exclusive with emerald unloading and dragon egg) -Interacting with a dragon egg will let the controller chunkload a 6-chunk radius forever, but normal siege danger is still possible. (Mutually exclusive with emerald unloading and nether star). Iron Golems: Now can\u2019t be produced anymore by villagers\u2026but can still be manufactured by the player. They now are more passive but also much more versatile. They will no longer roam freely and move unless they need to close in for melee combat. They can be ridden to easily move them around, note though that while riding a golem it will respond only to your movement command and will not attack anything. Also, they do not auto jump, so you must manually jump them when riding, but they can power jump like horses. They receive no damage from players and guards or other iron golems, to discard them use a wooden hoe. They now receive extra damage from explosions, lightning, and wither/dragon. They cannot be interacted with while you ride them. They have different textures to indicate if they are in normal mode, mining mode, or cannon mode. INTERACTIONS: -Using an iron ingot still, repair them at 25% HP; -Using a wooden hoe will kill them despawning them if you need to get rid of them; -Are tempted by torches in hand, like the village guards. -Sneak interacts with a torch to enable/disable hold ground mode, while holding ground the Golem is 1.5x bigger. -Interacted with a Copper block will enable ADVANCED FUNCTIONS for 10 minutes, other than giving them strength 2 for that time; while advanced functions are enabled: -Interacting with a\u00a0coal block, if they are not holding position, gives them 60 seconds of MINING MODE. While in this mode they break blocks in a surface of 5\u00d73, so you can ride them to quickly quarry a large area, but keep in mind that while in this mode they move very slowly, so you will need a lot of coal. Note that activating the MINING MODE will damage 30 HP from the golem, so you will need to repair it with iron from time to time. -Interacting with a\u00a0fire charge\u00a0gives them 60 seconds of powerful ranged attack, \u201cCANNON MODE\u201d, they use explosive bolts that deal 25 hp of damage, also their engaging range is very high. Note that they will not fire while in cannon mode if you ride them, they will find their targets themselves. -If one of the two advanced functions is enabled if you interact with a torch without sneaking will disable either the mining mode or the cannon mode. MULES (Multi Utility Land Engine): Can\u2019t be bred anymore from horses and donkeys, because they are now a mechanical unit similar to a minecart that must be crafted. They come with an accessible inventory, the space of a chest, fall, fire, and lava immunity. They also are immune to player and guard/golem damage, so you need to use a wooden hoe to discard them. They float in water and lava. ( To return to the land you must dig a hole 2-3 blocks wide and 3 blocks deep towards the land to let the flowing water or lava let you return to land). When not fueled they can\u2019t move. They can be interacted with while riding them. They have different textures if in normal mode or tree capital mode. INTERACTIONS: -Interacting with 1 coal fuels them for 60 seconds, they have quite good speed, easy control, and can power jump very high, also have slow falling. -Interacting with 1 COAL BLOCK fuels them for 10 minutes and also enables the \u201cCHOPPING MODE\u201d: further Interacting with 1 IRON INGOT makes the mule break any leaves and Oak, Acacia, Mangrove, bamboo, and cherry logs in a 3\u00d740 surface, so you can easily chop down even the highest trees. After the 60 seconds of Chopping mode, the fuel time is also depleted because it\u2019s an energy-intensive operation. -Interacting with phantom membranes, while they are powered with coal or coal block and not in chopping mode\u00a0 AND THE PLAYER HAS THE ELYTRA\u00a0 EQUIPPED, will give levitation for 10 seconds and high speed for 20 seconds, so it will be like flying. -interacting with 1 copper ingot will heal the mule 100% HP. -Interacting with a wooden hoe will destroy it, despawning it. -Interacting with a torch while they are fueled will shut the engine, consuming all the fuel left. While they are not fueled: -Interacting with a torch makes it slightly bigger and capable of pulling in up to 9 guards and golems in the right seat, so you can transport them easily, interact again with a torch while the engine is off to revert to normal transporting mode, forcing the passengers to dismount; -Interacting with 1 WHEAT makes it slightly bigger and capable of pulling in up to 2 of any entity, useful to transport villagers and animals, interact with a torch while the engine is off to revert to normal transportation mode, forcing all the passengers to dismount; -Interacting with 1 NETHERRACK makes it way bigger and capable of pulling in up to 9 guards and golems in the right seats, this mode is intended for use on the lava because with this size you can float over lava safely inside a mule. Interact with a torch while the engine is off to revert to normal transportation mode, forcing all the passengers to dismount; Hint: to make passengers dismount it is better to interact with a torch while you are riding them. TNT Minecraft (Long Range Transporter): This is no longer a TNT minecart! Instead, it acts as a chest minecart\u2026with hopper and chunkloading capabilities. It chunk loads a 2-chunk radius, useful for automatic long-range transportation. The recipe now requires a village controller. Also to prevent economic exploitations it will explode if inside a village, so it cannot be used to chunk load a village. If you need to transport goods from villages to your far-away industrial complex you will need to build an off-village loading station. To check if you are off the village you can use a village guard, you can tempt or make it follow you to the place you want to check and turn it into patrol mode, if the guards are agitated to return to the village you are actually off village, if the guard is normally patrolling then you are in the village. If you are clearly in the wild, there is no need to check, you are off the village and the tnt minecart will not explode. Piglin Barter, Villagers Trade, Wandering Traders Trades: Are now better and reflect also the uses of the new \u201cMANUFACTURING SYSTEM\u201d, you will find that a lot has changed here. Professions like armorer, weaponsmith, and leatherworker will sell more useful enchanted items, balanced with the diamond ones, they will reward you if you sell them exotic things, for example looting ancient cities, ocean monument now is more useful because you can sell that unique loot for lots of emeralds and trader xp. Piglin Barter has been changed to offer only useful things to survive in the nether, with a very small possibility of receiving ancient debris, also all the barter items offered by the piglins can be sold to one of the villager\u2019s profession for one emerald, creating a rewarding loop to inter-trade between nether and overworld. The wandering trader accepts some bartering items of the piglings and now offers much, much more to be bought and finally you can sell to the wandering trader a lot of refined products or loot. Other Changes to Vanilla: MANY NEW RECIPES: Many new recipes have been added, the majority involving the new \u201cMANUFACTURING SYSTEM\u201d that will be explained later. BOAT, RAFT, CHEST BOAT Can no more pull in any entities except for players and MULES, to prevent exploitations, you can still transport entities with minecarts and mules and then embark the mule inside the boat. CREEPER They don\u2019t drop gunpowder anymore (see later how to produce it) unless they are killed with a looting weapon. This is for balance reasons. TNT RECIPE is now 9 gunpowder. SHULKER BOXES, ENDER CHESTS, BOWS Have their recipe altered, they are much more expensive, for balance reasons. POWERED RAILS, RAILS Have now alternate recipes, normal rails in particular can be crafted either with iron or with copper, the copper recipe uses also coal. GOLD INGOTS, GOLD NUGGET One gold ingot makes 4 gold nuggets and 4 gold nuggets make a gold ingot. SEA LANTERN They require only 5 prismarine crystals. PIGLINGS Now they detect enemies further (24 range instead of vanilla 16) and are aggravated also by breaking nether quartz ore and Ancient Debris. ZOMBIE PIGMEN They are aggravated by breaking nether ores the same as Piglings. BLAZE POWDER now requires 9 blaze rods to craft 1 blaze powder, this is for balance reasons and also because blaze powder has very high-tech uses (see manufacturing system cleric chain). SMOKERS,\u00a0 BLAST FURNACES, BREWING STANDS are now much, much more expensive to craft because they are now treated as the machines of the new \u201cManufacturing System\u201d (See later).\u00a0 Also, the things that smokers and blast furnaces do in vanilla can be done with a normal furnace, so a new use for them is nice. HOPPERS Can also be crafted with 8 copper ingots. FIRE CHARGE the recipe is modified, involving 1 TNT and 1 firework rocket. When shot from a dispenser it is an exploding cannon shell. ELYTRA Can be duped with a recipe, like armor trims. The recipe needs phantom membranes. PHANTOM MEMBRANE Is craftable with 1 copper ingot and 2 coal ENCHANTED GOLDEN APPLE Can be duped using lapis blocks TRIDENT Can be crafted with iron and prismarine shards; NAUTILUS SHELL Can be crafted with prismarine shards; ARMOR TRIMS can be duped with 8 leather instead of all those diamonds, except for the netherite armor upgrade. POTTERY SHERDS can be duped with 8 prismarine blocks. SHULK SENSORS can be crafted from observers and some other materials. NETHER QUARTZ has a lot of more uses, in particular, can be used to craft overworld ores, in various combinations. This gives a reward to dangerously mine in the nether (piglings and pigment are now aggravated to mining nether quartz!). Nether quartz can be used in a blast furnace to turn it into Amethyst or in a smoker to turn it into coal. CHAINMAIL ARMOR now graphically appears like a copper armor and it is crafted with copper. COBWEBS are craftable with 9 strings LAPIS to experience Lapis in a blast furnace turn into enchanted bottles. Fire potion and saddle in the smoker the first is turned into a water bottle, the second in a coal block. (This is because of balance reasons and changes to piglin barter) Manufacturing System: As stated before, the village controller will collect items for each villager that has a profession, villagers with the same profession will only collect for one. Villagers can have one of 13 professions in vanilla, excluding unemployed and nitwits, the latter are automatically turned into guards if they grow up into nitwits. The collection cycle is distributed in the Minecraft day, for a total of two cycles, one during the day and one during the night. So for example the farmer will produce at sunrise and sunset, while the librarian at midday and midnight etc. The village controller will place the produce in its inventory that you can access but you can also place a hopper or minecart with a hopper below the village controller block statute,\u00a0 so you can automatically sort the items with a vanilla sorting system or minecart hopper system to distribute for your uses. Each of the items produced by the villagers can then be further processed inside Smokers, Blast Furnaces or Brewing stands to manufacture more refined products in often long manufacturing chains that you can automate using all vanilla systems (auto smelters, hopper item filters, minecart systems, etc. Let\u2019s see the production chains in detail: -TOOLSMITH:\u00a0[Produces 16 \u2013 32 mangrove logs per cycle, which can be transmuted into any other overworld log using the stonecutter], Mangrove logs can be further processed into the following SMOKER chain: Charcoal [which can be transmuted into Ice using any stonecutter] Obsidian [which can be transmuted into Packed ice using any stonecutter] Crying Obsidian [which can be transmuted into blue ice using any stonecutter] Coal Firework rocket Putting mangrove logs in a\u00a0blast furnace turns them into dried kelp. -STONE MASON: [Produces 64 \u2013 128 cobblestones per cycle] that can be further processed in the following BLAST FURNACE chain to have: Stone [which can be transmuted in any stonecutter into Deepslate and cracked stone bricks] Refined Stone [which can be transmuted in any stonecutter into andesite, diorite, and granite] Quartz block [which can be transmuted in any stonecutter into Refined quartz block, Tuff, Calcite, and dripstones] (note that the quartz block can\u2019t be crafted into nether quartz, which is a more high-tier material than a block with only aesthetic purposes. Putting cobblestone in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -LEATHER WORKER:\u00a0[Produces 64 \u2013 128 gravel per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Sand [which can be transmuted in red sand in any stonecutter] Glass [which can be transmuted into Tinted glass in any stonecutter] Sandstone [which can be transmuted into Red Sandstone and any color concrete powder in any stonecutter] Smooth Sandstone [ which can be transmuted into Red Smooth Sandstone and any color concrete in any stonecutter] Flint [which can be further processed into a smoker to obtain a mangrove log] Putting gravel in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -FISHERMAN:\u00a0[Produces 64 \u2013 128 dirt per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Mud [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into mangrove roots and mud with roots] Clay block [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into compact mud and mud bricks] Bricks [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into terracotta and single brick] Prismarine [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into all other pristine variants] Putting dirt in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -CARTOGRAPHER:\u00a0[Produces 64 \u2013 128 netherrack per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE\u00a0 to have the following chain: Nether Brick [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into all variants of Nether Bricks] Endstone [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into purpura block] Blackstone [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into Basalt and Polished Basalt] Soul Terrain [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into soul sand] Putting netherrack in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -FLETCHER:\u00a0[Produces 12 \u2013 24 sugar canes per cycle] that can be further processed in the BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Podsol [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into all flower types, all dirt types, leaves variants, and other biota] Crimsom Stem [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into warped stem, all alliums variants and warts variants] Bone meal Brown fungus Red fungus Crimson fungus Warped Fungus Gunpowder Putting sugar cane in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -SHEPHERD:\u00a0[Produces 12 \u2013 24 honeycomb per cycle] which can be further processed in a BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: White wool slime [Slime blocks can be transmuted in a stonecutter into honey blocks] Feather Ink sak Glow Ink sac Leather String Putting honeycomb in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -FARMER:\u00a0[produces 6 -12 pumpkins per cycle] which can be further processed in a SMOKER to have the following chain: Melon Wheat Carrot Cocoa [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into a cookie, sweet berries, and gold berries] Apple Potato Baked Potato [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into bread] Honey bottle [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into beetroot soup or mushroom soup[ Pumpkin pie [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into rabbit stew] Cake Raw Porkchop [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into any raw meat or fish] Putting pumpkins in a\u00a0blast furnace turns them into dried kelp. -BUTCHER:\u00a0[Produces 8 \u2013 16 raw copper per cycle] which can be further processed in a BLAST FURNACE to have the following chain: Copper ingot Glowstone block Lantern Shroomlight Ochre light [which can be transmuted in a stonecutter into other foglight variants] Sea Lantern End Rod Redstone Putting raw copper in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -LIBRARIAN: [Produces 2 -4 raw gold per cycle] which can be processed into a gold ingot in a blast furnace Putting raw gold in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -ARMORER: [Produces 4 \u2013 8 raw iron per cycle] which can be processed into an iron ingot in a blast furnace Putting raw iron in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -WEAPONSMITH:\u00a0[has 50% chance of producing a diamond per cycle] Putting diamonds in a smoker turns it into mangrove planks [fuel]. -CLERIC:\u00a0[Produces exactly 2 ghast tears per cycle, which is a very powerful substance now] Putting ghast tears in a smoker turns them into mangrove planks [fuel]. Ghast tears can be obtained also from prismarine shards and by putting in stonecutter echo shards, disk fragments, shook shriekers, and catalysts. When placed in a BLAST FURNACE ghast tears turn into Lingering potions of swiftness, which is not stackable but can be hopper automated as input of brewing stands, this solution can be put in a BLAST FURNACE to turn it back to Ghast tears, which is a stackable item. The lingering potions of swiftness are the input that can be used in the brewing stands bottom slots for advanced manufacturing (doubling and even tripling the reagent] when used with the following reagents (top slots): Diamonds Gold ingots Iron Ingots Copper Ingots Ender Pearls Spider Eyes Magma Cream Rabbit Foot Pufferfish Scute Blaze Powder Quartz Lapis Almost every item you can manufacture using the manufacturing chains can be sold to villagers for emeralds, the revenue is higher the further the item is in the production chain and the villager level is, i.e. you can trade to the level 2 Shepherd 21 wool for an emerald but also to the lvl 4 shepherd 9 leather for an emerald, so if you process the wool in the blast furnace chain from that 21 wool you can obtain 21 leather which is 2 at least 2 emeralds instead of 1 with 3 spare leather remaining. SMOKER USAGE: Processing in blast furnaces requires fuel though, so you need to power them, you can use any vanilla fuel or you can use SMOKERS to produce fuel. As described above, SMOKER chains can process TOOLSMITH PRODUCE and FARMER PRODUCE turning them into refined fuels or refined food respectively, but SMOKERS can process also all produce of the other villagers turning them into MANGROVE PLANKS to be recycled as fuel for your smokers and furnaces. So if you make an item sorter to collect items from the village controller you don\u2019t need an incinerator at the end of the hopper chain, you can put everything into a smoker to recycle them into useful fuel, it is a good way to use materials you don\u2019t need, for example, lots of netherrack to turn it into fuel, processing it in the SMOKER. Other than all the primary products, smokers can turn the following into fuel: Cobbled deepslate, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff, calcite, sand, glass, sandstone, polished sandstone, basalt, Blackstone, soul terrain and soul sand, Ice, Podsol, stems, and terracotta you find in mesa biomes. Compatibility: INSTALLING ON AN EXISTING WORLD: make sure you don\u2019t have tnt minecarts inside villages other,ise they will explode, also the changes to villages and wandering trades will apply only to new ones. OTHER MODS: Any third mod that changes any of the things mentioned in this guide, for example, villagers, villagers trades, mules, iron golems, the vanilla recipes here changed and so on will break the balance and functionalities of this mod. If you have a mod that has a custom player.json you may need the PVP version of this addon, note that other custom player.json could prevent the raid from happening at all. Treat it as any other addon,\u00a0you need to install the resource pack and one of the two behavior packs, full or PvP version. With Minecraft bedrock version 1.20 and higher no experiments are needed to play the mod, you can still enable them if other mods require them. There are 2 behavior pack versions of this addon: FULL VERSION: Has all the features described on this page but also prevents PVP, cactus, sweet berries, and magma blocks damage to the player because of a custom player.json file that prevents guards and Iron golems ranged friendly fire, and it is intended for single-player or public PVE only servers that allow chunk loading. PVP VERSION: Player.json is not modified, so pvp is possible at the cost of receiving friendly fire from guards and golems ranged attacks, TNT minecarts are not modified, so they are not the chunk-loading hopper long-range transports of the FULL Version, Village controllers cannot interact with Emerald blocks, emeralds, or dragon eggs all chunk-loading modes are not possible in this version. All these changes make this version of the addon Public server-friendly. If you want a version for a single player or a public server with only PVE you can try the FULL VERSION. Behavior (Full Version): \u2013 Behavior (PvP Version): \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "WorldEdit Addon (1.20, 1.19) is a popular addon for Minecraft: Bedrock, which is a port of the renowned WorldEdit Mod from Minecraft: Java Edition. This addon introduces custom commands to simplify and enhance your building experience. It also includes custom items to make it more accessible to users across different devices. The WorldEdit : Bedrock Edition is packed with a multitude of significant features that are also found in the original mod. These features encompass: Manipulation of the clipboard (Cut, Copy, Paste) A handy WorldEdit kit for easy access to prevalent features The ability to stack and move blocks and regions Functions to rotate and flip regions Robust block patterns and masks Navigation commands for ease of movement Generation of shapes, both built-in, and custom Creation of walls, lines, and outlines Terrain smoothing for a more natural look Undo and redo capabilities for correcting mistakes Filling and replacing blocks for quick modifications Painting with brushes for artistic touches Saving and loading structures, which requires an app for cross-world operations Modifying biomes, also requires an app. Some creations made with WorldEdit: Please read the quick start section in Settings > How to Play while playing in a WorldEdit-enabled world, for a short guide on how the addon works. Firstly, go to the download section link appropriate for your Minecraft version. Just go through as instructed and a file called \u201cWorldEdit.mcaddon\u201d should be downloaded. After downloading the addon, you open it with Minecraft, and it will be imported into your game. Android users need to use a third-party file explorer such as File Manager to open the file. iOS users should use Documents for iOS . Once there, choose a world you want to apply this addon to and add the behavior pack and resource pack together. The \u201cHoliday Creator Features\u201d, and \u201cBeta APIs\u201d experiments must also be enabled. And that\u2019s it! Your world is now ready for WorldEdit. Third-Party Servers The version for the third-party server is \u201cWorldEdit.server.zip\u201d and it contains the behavior pack folder, resource pack folder, and the addon\u2019s \u201cvariables.json\u201d file which is used to customize the addon\u2019s function. Installing the packs depends on the server and its method hosting, but \u201cvariables.json\u201d must be placed in the server\u2019s \u201cconfig/default\u201d folder or \u201cconfig/<module uuid>\u201d folder, where the UUID is the addon\u2019s UUID defined in its behavior pack manifest file. Aternos\u00a0server Note: Aternos doesn\u2019t seem to accept JSON files, so you may need to use the normal mcaddon version of the addon with it. To properly add this addon to an Aternos server, you first need to upload an already existing world with the required experimental features enabled. Do not upload a world with the addon already applied to it! You must then install the addon separately in the server\u2019s packs folder. WorldEdit Mod mcaddon: \u2013 mcaddon: \u2013 Zip: \u2013",

This addon allows players to choose their magic type and provides them with permanent items in their inventory that contain skills. These skills will not be lost even upon death. The magic types available are Soul, Frost, and Demolition, each with its own set of passive abilities, basic attacks, and skills. For instance, the Soul type can deal wither effect damage, switch positions with mobs, summon undead zombies, and more. The Frost type can slow down enemies, freeze and trap entities, and summon an entity that shoots ice balls rapidly. The Demolition type is immune to all types of explosions, can shoot bombs, and summon explosive fireworks that track enemies. In addition to the magic system, the add-on introduces a new mana system, new items, and new structures. Players can upgrade their mana by standing on the beacon in the spawn point. New items such as Mana Bottle, Elixir, Mana Gem, and more can be found in structures and dropped by entities. These items can restore mana, enhance mana regeneration, or trigger random events when consumed. The addon also introduces new entities called \u201cShifted\u201d monsters, which are tougher, faster, stronger, and do not burn in daylight. These include Shifted Zombie, Shifted Skeleton, Shifted Creeper, and Shifted Spider. Each of these monsters has unique abilities and can drop mana essence or other items upon defeat. Make sure you activated the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Have you ever felt that Minecraft was getting a bit too easy? Lacking in its more Fantastical elements? Or just want a new way to experience the game? If so then Mysticraft is for you. Mysticraft Addon (1.20, 1.19) not only adds 27 amazing addons, 150+ new structures, and over 100 unique creatures but introduces a multitude of magic items and a new way to interact with death and health, in a way that\u2019ll hopefully make your experience fresh and evermore challenging. Mysticraft adds a slew of new creatures and enemies to face, beefing up most hostile and neutral creatures as well as making slight changes to certain mob behaviors. (This won\u2019t be the whole list (there are over 100)) Pyre Drake , this flaming lizard is a destructive force of flame, able to reduce any adventurers that cross its domain in the plains or forests to ash and bone. Glacis Drake , this creature of frost builds its nests anywhere as icey as itself, though this makes it rare than the pyre drake, it\u2019s just as ferocious as its flaming cousin.

Some sandwiches and new food combos: New Baked goods and Pastries: And much more! To craft most of these you must first craft either the spell table or the conjuring table: Spell table Conjuring table Frostbinger staff \u2013 Casts a large ball of frost, temporarily freezing its surroundings Fireball staff \u2013 Casts a ball of fire Thunderstrike staff \u2013 Casts a bolt of lightning Instantaneous staff \u2013 Allows you to teleport through any distance or dimension Gold ring \u2013 Used as a base for crafting Amethyst ring Amethyst ring \u2013 Can be infused with Potion effects After crafting an Amethyst ring, use a brewing stand to infuse the ring with any Potion effect.

Every time you die you lose 1 heart only able to gain it back by crafting and consuming it. 50 hearts being the limit. This uses totems in its crafting recipe, and if these are too difficult to obtain, simply craft them. To craft a Totem you must first obtain a Shattered totem, either from the Rotten evoker or certain structures, and mend it using gold nuggets as seen below, then just use the recipe above \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Simple Roguelike Dungeon Addon (1.20) introduces a fresh dimension to your Minecraft world: procedurally generated dungeons. These multi-level labyrinths are teeming with monsters and treasure. Since each dungeon layout is randomly created, you\u2019ll likely never encounter the same design twice. Navigating these dungeons can be challenging due to their intricate network of rooms and corridors. There are five tiers, and as you descend deeper, the challenges become more formidable. Be prepared with decent gear, as things can get intense down there. Plus, the loot improves as you venture into lower tiers. While these dungeons are rare, the effort spent exploring is well worth it if you seek adventure! The Entrance: You can find these structures in your world that are generated in the overworld across most biomes, except for oceans, rivers, mushroom islands, and mountains. Inside the entrance, you will find a staircase that leads to the dungeon in the underground. Tier 1: Welcome to Tier 1, which has two categories of rooms: Monster Rooms and Feature Rooms. Monster Rooms contain spawners and loot, as the name suggests. Feature rooms, on the other hand, don\u2019t have spawners, it can be a laboratory room, or it can be a room with a cake,\u2026 Overall, this tier is not too difficult and can be cleared with just iron armor. Tier 2: This tier is pretty much the same as Tier 1. It uses the same pool of room that Tier 1 uses. Tier 3: This is where it starts getting more intense. Feature rooms no longer generate on this tier, and the number of spawners increases. But the loot is worth the risk. Tier 4: Husks, strays, and cave spiders start spawning at this tier. And it can be very hard, you should better bring better armor and weapons. Tier 5: This tier is quite similar to Tier 4. And you can find very good loot at this tier. If you are lucky then you may stumble upon a reward room with a lot of loot. Limitations: This dungeon can currently only generate within 5\u00d75 chunks at this moment, this is a pretty big problem. This limitation not only restricts the size of the dungeon but also limits the content and creativity that the creator can put into it. This add-on still has room for improvement so the author will try to add more in future updates. Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. mcpack: \u2013",

            "description": "Natural Structure Redone Addon (1.21, 1.20) enhances the atmosphere of your Minecraft world by adding subtle details like sticks and bushes scattered throughout the environment. These items are easy to spot on the ground and help locate certain materials. Unlike the original, it is compatible with version 1.19 and above and includes expanded features for each block. Biome-specific updates are also planned. This update adds desert and mesa foliage to your Minecraft World! Cactus Now there is more variety for cacti! (And a very rare secret block and structure!) The normal cacti generate in the desert and are desert exclusive! The Blue Cacti generate exclusively in the Mesa/Badlands. Dragon Fruit can drop randomly when you break the taller variants of Cacti Desert Foliage Added a multitude of plants to the arid areas! Both the Mesa and the Desert have their own specific plant sets. The plants also have varying rarities, for instance, the wildflower and the slime cacti are the rarest! Cacti Flowers Pink Cactus Flowers will spawn in 1\u2019s while White Cactus flowers only spawn in 3\u2019s Low Hanging Brambles Some extra dried foliage that\u2019s fitting for arid biomes. You can now get sticks out of mangrove roots with the flint scraper Cactus can now be compressed into a Cactus Block New bone sand block that generates in the desert! Can give bones and other items\u2026 Updates to the Coarse Sifter, Can now sift sand for desert foliage if they do not spawn in your world. Has Rtx Compatability Salt Salt will now generate around the world in either stone ore form or sand ore form on the surface. You have to use a stone tool or above to get Pink Rock Salt. Create Blocks and a lamp with pink rock salt! Crush pink rock salt into powder to use on the drying table! Drying Table With Utilities come Drying Tables! Drying Tables have an upgradable item that allows the use of salt and halves the time it takes to dry items. You can dry a variety of items: Leaves Kelp Apple Rotten Flesh Meat Chunks Mortal and Pestle The author had completely redone the Mortar and Pestle! Now in order to balance the mortar and pestle you will have to use the pestle to create dyes! Craft an Andesite Mortar and a suitable pestle. Pestles will now lose durability on every use! Now Flowers will create Petals, Crush those petals inside of the mortar! Extras: You will have to create Sugar by crushing it too (Bonemeal too). Flint Scraper This is a tool that is a utility item, which is necessary for bark! Bark Can create a multitude of items, ranging from woodchips, all the way back to paper. Paper Has also been redone, You will now have to make paper pulp (the traditional way) or the (bark way) and dry it on the drying table! New Wood Fences and Branches! Created with their respective wood type, create the fence versions with 2 branches! Giving Paper more uses, the author created Paper Lanterns! The creator has added the new Coarse Sifter. Use this block to sift dirt and have access to pebbles which will enable the ability to access the flint scraper and everything necessary in finding every block. You can also find Pink Rock Salt rarely to help speed up those drying racks! General Blocks Landscape Photos Nimberry Nimberry bushes spawn in the plains and in the meadows. Each berry gives you a 3-second speed boost to help traverse the flat plains You can also make a Nimberry Bowl which will give you 10 seconds of speed and 2 and a half a bar of hunger. Stacks to 16. Ground Foliage Mushrooms are Red and Brown. Red Mushrooms are most often seen in Birch forests and in swamps.

            "description": "Poggy\u2019s Better on Bedrock Addon (1.21, 1.20) (previously known as Vanilla Plus) is a Minecraft Bedrock addon that tries to improve the overall gameplay of the base vanilla game. It aims to improve a lot of aspects by improving and adding new bosses, blocks, items, mobs, structures, biomes, and systems. In the latest update, Better on Bedrock: Nether Arise adds new creatures, bosses, and buildings to the nether. The overworld has some changes too, but the nether is the main focus. And there\u2019s also this strange amulet the creator discovered. Created by: XxPoggyisLitxX Twitter Inside Better on Bedrock, you\u2019ll find numerous improvements to vanilla biomes. Some of these biomes will have their own exclusive structures, mobs, and ores. Forest: Plains: Roofed Forest: Birch: Beach: Savanna: Taiga: Swamp: Jungle: Items and blocks inside of Better on Bedrock will have their own unique features to keep them fresh. Let\u2019s start with items: Gilded Netherite Armor: Tinted Netherite Armor will save you against Piglins while keeping you protected. Using 1 Gold Armor peace to protect yourself against Piglins comes with the cons where you are losing that extra bit of protection. Tinted Netherite Armor will protect you against Piglins while being fully protected. It has the same stats as regular Netherite Armor. Obtainable via Forge Table Copper Armor: Copper Armor is stronger than Leather Armor but weaker than Iron Armor. Copper Armor is used for early combat when you go caving and a lot of mobs attack you. Lootbag: Need some quick resources? Get some Lootbags. Lootbags are found within Trader Outpost chests. To use a Lootbag, right-click (hold for mobile, LT/L2 for the controller) to use the Lootbag. Once you use a Lootbag you\u2019ll get some sweat resources. Backpack: The inventory issue has been solved! Backpacks give you extra slots to store your goodies. Holding a BackPack and interacting (hold for mobile, LT/L2 for the controller) will open up the BackPack inventory. BackPacks can be used across all dimensions. The Regular BackPack has 9 Slots. The Medium Backpack has 24 Slots Quest Scroll: New to this amazing world? Use quests for early loot! The Quest System is a unique system within Better on Bedrock. The Quest System gives players some Quests to complete in a new world. Players will be given a Closed Quest Scroll upon loading a new world. When they interact (hold for mobile, LT/L2 for the controller) it will open up the scroll which players can interact again (hold for mobile, LT/L2 for the controller) to open the Quest UI. The Quest UI will show you 3 Tiers: New Start, Better on Bedrock, and Beyond the Overworld. Each Quest has specific goals for the player to complete. When you complete Quests you have to claim your rewards manually. Bounty Scroll: Bounty System can only be accessed by a Bounty Board The Bounty System allows players to hunt down a specific number of mobs for rewards and maybe even to progress their playthrough. It has the same use and UI as the Quest System. Overworld Waystone Key: The Overworld Waystone Key is used to save your Waystones and teleport to your Waystones When you click on a waystone (tap for mobile, LT/L2 for controller) you\u2019ll be prompted with a UI to enter the Waystone Name. You can only add up to 10 per dimension. When you break a saved waystone you need to save it again when the block was placed. When you want to teleport to a saved waystone, right-click (tap for mobile, LT/L2 for controller) to access all saved Waystones. Click on a saved Waystone to teleport, which costs 3xp levels. Once teleported the Waystone Key will be on a 60-sec cooldown. Grapes: Grapes is a new food source found within Better on Bedrock. You can only find Grapes inside of Taiga Biomes. Grapes can be planted and grown for an infinite source of grapes. Grapes gives 4 Hunger Points and takes 1 Second to eat. Wild Carrot: The Wild Carrot is another new Food Source within Better on Bedrock. You can find Wild Carrots inside of the Plains Biome. Wild Carrots have a small chance of dropping a regular carrot. Wild Carrot gives 3 Hunger Points. Enderman Tear: The Enderman Tear is obtainable by killing an Enderman. The Enderman Tear is used to craft an Overworld Waystone Key. Forge Table: The use of the Forge Table is to forge Gold Ingots with your Netherite Armor. When you Forge your Armor, you need at least 1 Gold Ingot and 1 Netherite Armor peace to forge them together. When your Armor was enchanted, the enchants with convert over to your Forged Netherite Armor. Forged Netherite Armor will behave like Gold Armor around Piglins except you don\u2019t have the weak protection of Golden Armor. Miner\u2019s Bench: The use of the Miners\u2019 Bench is to apply Vein Miner I to your pickaxes. When you want to apply the enchantment to your pickaxe, you need the Vein Miner I enchantment book and 6xp levels to enchant Overworld Waystone: The Overworld Waystone is used to save your spot! With the Overworld Waystone you can have up to 10 per dimension saved, anywhere in the world! You can travel thousands of blocks within an instant with the Overwolrd Waystone. You need an Overworld Waystone Key to Save and Teleport to save Overworld Waystones. The Overworld Waystone is crafted with 5 Iron Ingots, 1 Gold Ingot, and 1 Ender Pearl. Bounty Board: The Bounty Board is found by a unique structure called The Trader Outpost. The Bounty Board give you a Closed Bounty Scroll when you interact with the block. You can only do so ONCE per world Vein Miner: A new enchantment has seen its debut in Better on Bedrock. Vein Miner can be obtained by trading with a Goblin Trader or at the top of Battle Towers. Vein Miner includes Unbreaking 1 by default. Each ore that the Vein Miner breaks will remove 1 durability from your pickaxe. (Since you have Unbreaking it will be random.) Tree Capitator I: Another enchantment made its way to Better on Bedrock. Similar to Vein Miner, Tree Capitator will chop down trees within an instant! Your axe will take 1 durability damage per log that has been broken. Goblin Trader: This little guy has almost anything you need. You can find the cute guy anywhere in the world, but not often as he is on his own adventure gathering resources to sell you. Goblin Trader Info: 20 Health Passive The Willager: A new boss made its way in Better on Bedrock. The Willager is part of the Illager Family and he won\u2019t be easy to get by. To find him you need to do a little adventuring. He is located at the top of a Battle Tower that is different from the others. Make sure you\u2019re prepared because the fight won\u2019t be easy! Willager Info: 250 Health Hostile Is Boss 4 Attacks Armor Requirements: Minimum Armor Requirements: Full Protection 4 Iron Armor Recommended Armor Requirements: Full Protection 2 Diamond Armor Drops: Willager Hat Loot Crate Trader Outpost: Found all over the overworld. Home of the Wandering Trader. Battle Tower: Found all over the Overworld. Test your combat skills with floors becoming more difficult, great rewards at the end. Waystone Tower: Home of the Overworld Waystone. Climb to the top to obtain a Waystone and some loot! Ruined Temple: Adventurer Campsite: Starter home to the lost traveler. Adventurer House: Home base of the lost traveler. Hardcore Mode Option: Upon loading up a new world you\u2019ll be prompted with a Difficulty UI. Normal Mode is the default gamemode with infinite lives and Hardcore Mode\u2026 well it\u2019s self-explanatory. Hardcore Hearts are enabled by default for both Modes. Waystone: Waystone Key: Backpack: Forge Table: Miners\u2019 Bench: This addon will work with other addons. This addon won\u2019t work with multi-player or servers.

            "description": "Quarry Addon (1.21, 1.20) adds a quarry block that can extract ores like diamonds, iron, coal, gold, red stone, emeralds, and everything that is found, such as stone, obsidian, dirt, etc. The quarry block is placed on the ground and tapped on to show the size of the area that needs to be clear of blocks for the quarry to be built. Simply place the quarry block on the ground, tap on it and it will show you the size of the area that needs to be clear of blocks for the quarry to build. For the quarry to be built you must hit one of the four screens that will appear around that area until it turns green, if the screen remains red it means that there are blocks in the construction area. Once the quarry is built you can touch one of the four screens around the quarry to open the settings You will find four different quarry blocks: the small-packed quarry, the medium-packed quarry, the large-packed quarry, and the packed explosive quarry, each with different excavation sizes. Small Quarry: 7\u00d77 Medium Quarry: 11\u00d711 Large Quarry: 15\u00d715 Quarry settings options: Destroy: Activation will destroy the quarry and return the packed quarry to you. (The drill must be retracted) Retract drill: This option will retract the drill once you have finished using the quarry. Ignore alerts: If this option is enabled the quarry will not stop if it finds indestructible blocks in the digging zone unless the blocks are directly below the drill: Max power: This option allows you to dig twice as fast in exchange for more fuel. (+3 de redstone per layer) Silk touch: This will allow you to obtain blocks such as glass, ores, chests, and many more in their original state. (+2 de redstone per layer) Quarry On/Off: It will activate and deactivate the quarry if it has fuel and there are no alerts. Redstone/Fuel: In this slider, you can add and remove redstone with a maximum storage of 999 redstone. (Above this option you can see the redstone available in your inventory) To apply all these settings you must press the save settings button. The quarry consumes one redstone per layer To retract the drill you need at least one redstone. Opening the settings of the quarry will stop it temporarily. Only one player at a time can open the settings of a quarry You can rotate the outlet tube of the items if you interact with its center. You can find the crafts on the crafting table in survival mode. You can slide down the drill pipe if you interact with it. Going up or down will depend on whether you look down or up. Water and lava won\u2019t be a problem for the quarry but maybe it will be for you. You can find the packed quarries in the construction tab of creative mode. The explosive quarry will be available for the next update. Watch the video for the basic explanation: Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013 mcaddon: \u2013",

            "description": "Have you ever wished for a new dungeon in your Minecraft world that resembles a Mineshaft or Stronghold? If so, you\u2019re in luck! With Creeping Crypts: Random Dungeons Addon (1.21, 1.20), you\u2019ll discover tower-like structures in your world that contain dungeons beneath them. These dungeons can be quite extensive, so make sure to pack an extra lunch! These dungeons are made up of several rooms. As you explore your world, you may come across structures that resemble these from time to time. If you enjoy this Addon, be sure to share it with your friends! These structures are \u201cvery rare\u201d. They may not generate within 500-3000 blocks of you. The dungeons can get quite expansive at times, however, if you have a low-end device, your screen could potentially freeze for a few seconds while it generates. These dungeons will not cut into each other, instead, they are programmed to connect to themselves so you can avoid the eyesore of them ramming into each other nonsensically. Here is a showcase of the dungeon being generated in a flat world: Preferably you need a device that isn\u2019t low-end. For example, we do not recommend using a Samsung A03. For iOS Installation: For Windows 10: just double-click. To use this Add-On, you must turn this experiment on. Also, note that there are TWO packs for versions 1.0.1 and higher. You must enable both for it to work.\u00a0The 1.0.0 version still works as previously, but requires the \u201cCustom Biomes\u201d toggle to work and only works on versions below 1.20.30. Remember to delete the previous packs before installing, otherwise, the next packs will not install. mcaddon: \u2013 mcaddon: \u2013",

No experimental activation is required before using this addon in a new world. The builder wand is compatible with custom blocks: Builder Wand (mode selection): Sneak and use this item to select mode, if you don\u2019t select mode before using, the builder wand will not work. How it works? To save the coordinate you just need to use the item in a block. This addon is based on two coordinates, the first coordinate will save the block used to build, and the second coordinate will open the confirmation UI. This addon does not require any Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013",

There are also a few structures that will generate naturally in your world. One is a small farm shack with a few of the custom crops planted outside of it. The other is just the Cherry Trees. Learn to master the brew With version newest version of this addon, the Brewing Update arrived in bum_Crops! This update brings a brand new, complex brewing mechanic that allows players to brew various types Ale, Mead, and Wine. There are currently 27 different possible brews; each with its own ingredients and effects! The process of brewing is slightly complicated and requires a few precursor ingredients, depending on what type of brew you\u2019re trying to make. Here is a brief explanation of the process below: First of all, no matter what we\u2019re brewing, we need to start with some water and sugar to prepare the yeast for fermentation. At a Crafting Table, use bottled water and sugar to craft Sugar Water. Once you have the\u00a0Sugar Water, we\u2019re going to move to a\u00a0Brewing Stand. Put the Sugar Water into the bottom slots and for the reagent, we\u2019re going to put Yeast. By mixing\u00a0Yeast\u00a0and\u00a0Sugar Water, we\u2019re priming the yeast for fermentation and producing\u00a0Activated Yeast. If you don\u2019t have any Yeast, it can be sometimes found as a byproduct when harvesting shrooms. Alternatively, you can produce\u00a0Yeast\u00a0with\u00a0bottled water\u00a0and\u00a0wheat\u00a0at a\u00a0Brewing Stand. Now, depending on if you want to make Ale, Mead, or Wine; this next step will be different. You will want to keep your Activated Yeast in the bottom slot of the Brewing Stand, and for brewing Ale you will put in Hops as the reagent. For\u00a0Wine, replace\u00a0Hops\u00a0with\u00a0Grapes, and for\u00a0Mead, use\u00a0Honeycomb. This will produce a base for your final brew. With\u00a0Ale, you get a\u00a0Wort Base. Now that you have your\u00a0Wort Base\u00a0(or\u00a0fermented grapes/fermented honey) you will need a\u00a0Keg\u00a0block. If you do not have one, you can craft a Keg with a Barrel at a Crafting Table. Once you have your Keg placed, interact with it and you will see a bunch of recipe options in your recipe book for producing \u201cAle\u201d. Each recipe will produce a unique blend with unique effects. To get the most out of your brews, you\u2019ll want to keep track of what batch is what and what effects different ingredients produce! Learn to master the brew Works great on servers and is perfect for economy roleplay! Figure out a good recipe. Brand it and sell it to other players. STONKS! Before you know it, you\u2019ll have competing breweries on your server! *The development team has plans to expand and add even more brew types and recipes in the future so please share your opinions and ideas! *They may add a way to customize brew bottles using dye, to further customize and distinguish your batches and brands! The following is the only required experimental toggle! mcaddon: Zip: mcaddon: \u2013 Zip: \u2013 mcaddon: \u2013",

            "description": "Rustic Decorations Addon (1.20) is a spin-off of Rustic Agriculture. Many players have expressed interest in having the decoration section as a separate entity. This allows for more customization options to be added to each section. For instance, this version includes two additional variants of tables and one more variant of chairs. Users can now choose their favorite part of the addon. Moreover, this addon addresses a significant issue that arose with version 1.20.40 on mobile devices. Rustic Agriculture is incompatible with these devices. Rustic Decorations has already been tested on a mobile device and works flawlessly. Cabinet This new block is an alternative to the vanilla chest. You can put it in all directions. It can only be opened from the front and you can put another one on top to form a double cabinet! The regular cabinet has the same space as a chest and the double cabinet has the same space as a double chest. Pot For now, it is only decorative All terracotta variants Lanterns A new light source that comes in 2 variants: Iron (Vanilla) Gold (Vanilla) Candles The new light source comes in 2 variants: Iron (Vanilla) Gold (Vanilla) Chains The copper chains have the same properties as the copper, you can use an axe to deoxidize and become to wax Chandelier New decorative block that comes in 3 variants: Iron (Vanilla) Gold (Vanilla) Gargoyle Just a decorative block Painted Planks New colorful planks to decorate your world Clay Wall If you sneak and place Clay Wall Diag it will change its orientation Plank Tables 12 new tables with 10 vanilla woods Log Tables 12 new tables with 10 vanilla woods Stripped Tables 12 new tables with 10 vanilla woods Barrel This barrel is just decorative, if at some point a component to store things in blocks comes out, this barrel will have that function. Wooden Lanterns A variant lantern can be put on the floor, walls, and roofs. Plank Chairs These chairs are functional and are in all types of wood Log Chairs These chairs are functional and are in all types of wood. Iron Lattice The iron lattice is a decorative block. It will connect to adjacent lattice blocks and solid blocks. Using leaves on a lattice block will give the lattice a leafy cover. Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

One of the biomes that the Better Vanilla add-on enhances is the Dunes biome, composed of arid sand. Unfortunately, due to a Minecraft bug, creating entirely new biomes is impossible. Instead, existing biomes are replaced. In this case, the Dunes biome replaces the desert biome. This addon is a Bedrock port of Environmental Mod for Java Edition by TeamAbnormals. Arid sand: It makes up the dune biome Red arid sand. Spawns at the bottom of rivers and seas are generated in the dune biome: Arid sandstone, red arid sandstone.

            "description": "Spectrite Addon (1.19) adds new fresh ore, as well as vibrantly colored tools that will present a challenge to acquire in survival mode. Additionally, two new types of armor, blocks, and weapons with unique abilities are included among other features. All of these items can be obtained in survival mode. This addon adds four variants of the Specrite ore saying, which will appear in different dimensions of the game. This mineral may appear in layers 26-0, with a rarity equal to diamond This mineral may appear in layers 0 to the lowest, with a rarity equal to diamond. Ore that appears anywhere in the nether, but is very rare to find. This mineral abounds in the End, it will be found scattered everywhere with a fairly low iteration. This item is what you get when you chop one of these Spectrite ores. To get the gem, you will have to cook the raw Specrite: Weapons and tools These are diamond tools and conjoined spectrite, it could be said that it is an alloy. These tools are twice as powerful as diamond tools. Elaboration: First, we need the Diamond wand to make these objects. Diamond Spectrite Sword Diamond Spectrite Pickaxe Diamond Spectrite axe Diamond Spectrite Shovel These tools may be necessary if you don\u2019t have a lot of Spectrite material. It\u2019s a pretty decent option. These are the most important and useful tools of the addon. For obvious reasons, they are more expensive to perform. They are twice as strong and slightly stronger than Diamond tools. And they have unique abilities. Elaboration: For this preparation, we need the pure Specrite rod. Spectrite Sword Damage: 12 Ability: Features a sweep that reaches multiple entities in a row Spectrite Pickaxe Ability: With this pick, you can mine 3\u00d73 blocks for more efficient mining Spectrite axe Ability: With this axe, you can cut down a complete tree just by removing the lower trunk. Spectrite Shovel (No skill at the moment) Super Spectrite Sword Damage: 16 Hability: This sword works like Spectrite\u2019s pure sword, but has the ability to summon lightning for each hit on an entity. Spectrite Armor This is the main armor of the add-on, which will have double the durability and protection of a Diamond armor. Also adds a resistance effect. Similar to vanilla armor. Spectrite blocks These blocks are for decoration only. You can make them on a crafting table. Spectrite Glass Identification of special objects. The special items have very colorful characters: Steel tools Tools double the resistance of iron tools and one more point of damage: Elaboration: First, we need their respective ingot. In this way, this and the other remaining tools of the ingot are made Steel armor Each piece of this armor has two more points of protection than iron pieces and twice the durability of iron armor. Elaboration: This armor and the other remaining pieces are made in this way. Rose Gold This mineral is added as another extra to the addon. Elaboration: Rose blocks Thanks to this mineral you will have new decoration blocks for your decorations. Make sure you activated the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

Uncrafting Table: Used to break apart damaged or unwanted items for their resources. Splicer: Used to craft mob eggs, soul-based weapons, and a few other nature items that usually need shears/silk touch.

            "description": "The Chisel Mod is a very popular decoration mod used frequently on the Java edition but the Bedrock Edition has not had access to it, until now. That\u2019s right the author has figured out a way to bring chisel to bedrock edition and it uses one of the brand new blocks the stone cutter! In the Java version, a chisel was added to the game. In the case of the pocket version, a new block appears in the game \u2013 a stone cutter. The main function of Chisel Addon (1.19) is to improve the appearance of the blocks. After processing the blocks with a chisel, the blocks are suitable for decorating structures, interiors, and structures. In the future, the developers promise to add to this list and include even more blocks. All wood planks All concrete colors Stone Cobblestone Brick Diorite Andesite Granite Chisel Basalt Nether Update Basalt Limestone Marble Endstone PurPur Prismarine Glowstone (yes it still gives off the light!) Obsidian Lava Cobble Magma Blocks Coal and Charcoal Packed Ice Quartz Diamond Emerald Lapis Dirt Iron Gold Honeycomb Red and Yellow Sandstone Redstone Red and Normal NetherBrick Netherrack Terracotta (Just the basic block no colors) Factory Block Laboratory Block Paper Block Warped and Crimson Planks Glass Bookshelves Crafting table for all wood types Marble, limestone, and basalt were transferred from the PC version of the mod to the pocket version. Decorative blocks will naturally generate in the game.\u00a0Limestone \u2013 underground in swamps, marble \u2013 in extreme mountains, basalt \u2013 at level 20 and below.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry about already created worlds \u2013 new blocks are obtained by crafting. Marble Limestone Basalt Lava Cobble Lava cobble is obtainable by crafting cobblestone surrounding a bucket of lava. Factory Laboratory Paper New variant blocks allow for connected textures for blocks already in Chisel. Blocks with light blue names have variants! Current blocks with Connected Texture Variants: Laboratory Factory Andesite Granite Diorite Basalt Bricks Cobblestone Stone Endstone PurPur Limestone Marble Glowstone All concrete colors To craft simply place Chisel block back in the stone-cutter and variants will pop up if it has any! Updated trim blocks now rotate depending on which block face they are placed on! Crafting is super simple as well! Simply take one of the blocks that is currently implemented and just put it in the stone cutter. All the blocks it can craft will be displayed for you to choose! Then to craft back into base material place the chiseled block back in the stone cutter! To make alternate wood-type crafting tables place a crafting table in the crafting grid beside the wood type you want it to match. Make sure the block is beside the crafting table. Will most likely make this a shapeless recipe in a later update. Chisel Addon: \u2013 Slab Expansion Pack: \u2013 (Requires Chisel Addon installed)",

            "description": "World\u2019s Best Building Addon (1.19) contains a whopping 7,928 new blocks in total! Among them, you will find 25 distinct shapes made of each material that can be rotated. Additionally, it introduces new elements like Concrete Stairs and Slabs, Vertical Carpet, Gold and Copper Bars, Diagonal Fences, Vine Covered Fences, Red Nether Brick Fences, Copper and Gold Chains, New Colorful Torches, Torches of Every Wood Type, New Colorful lanterns, and 144 fresh hues of wood planks and fences. In this addon, you\u2019ll discover an impressive collection of 7,928 new blocks. Among them, you can craft 25 fresh shapes using nearly any material, and you have the freedom to rotate them in any direction using the new wrench tool. Additionally, you can enjoy 144 new shades of wood planks and colorful fences. But that\u2019s not all: Concrete Stairs and Slabs Vertical Carpet (Called Tapestry) Gold and Copper Bars Diagonal Metal Bars Metal Bars with Vertical/Horizontal Texture Copper Bars Actually Oxidize Diagonal Fences Vine Covered Fences Red Nether Brick Fence Copper and Gold Chains Chains actually connect, similar to fences. Copper chains actually oxidize Diagonal Chains 16 New Colorful Torches Torches of Every Wood Type Torchlight level is adjustable 48 New Colorful lanterns Lanterns come in gold, copper, or iron The Lantern Light level is adjustable Adds copper nugget and red nether brick 1. Place a block into a stonecutter to obtain the shapes. 2. To craft the Wrench, place three iron ingots into a crafting table. 3. To rotate a shape, simply right-click while holding a wrench. You can hold it in either hand. Keep right-clicking until it is facing the direction that you want. 4. Alternatively if you do not want to use the wrench, you can right click with an empty hand while crouching. You obtain the new planks by surrounding any color of dye with wood in a crafting table like the image below. \u200bEach wood type produces a different shade of color.\u00a0Some wood types are bright and some are dull! The new shapes are obtained\u00a0using a stonecutter. Craft the Wrench by placing 3 iron ingots into a crafting table diagonally. \u200bYou can rotate shapes by right-clicking them with the wrench in EITHER HAND. Alternatively, you may right-click it with an empty hand + crouch to rotate the block. You can also craft fences, fence gates, slabs, and stairs (using the vanilla recipes) 1. There are two ways to craft a colorful torch. The first way is to place a dye above a coal and stick. 2. The second way is to simply put a dye above an existing torch. This way is much less efficient. 3. You can adjust their light level anywhere between 1 to 15 by simply\u00a0crouching and right clicking with an empty hand. 4. If a torch does not appear correct when placed, try using the Torch II version of that torch by simply placing the torch into a crafting slot. Torch II behaves a little bit more like fences in the sense that they will \u201cconnect\u201d to anything near them. 1. To craft a lantern, simply surround a colorful torch with either gold nuggets, copper nuggets, or iron nuggets. 2. You can adjust the light level by\u00a0right clicking while crouching with an empty hand. 3. It\u2019s possible to make hanging lanterns. Just be sure to LOOK STRAIGHT UP when placing them. 1. To craft different wood-type torches, simply place a single wooden plank below the stick and coal in the crafting grid. \u200b2. You can adjust their light level anywhere between 1 to 15 by simply\u00a0crouching and right clicking with an empty hand. 3.\u00a0If a torch does not appear correct when placed, try using the Torch II version of that torch by simply placing the torch into a crafting slot. Torch II behave a little bit more like fences in the sense that they will \u201cconnect\u201d to anything near them. 1. You are now able to craft copper and gold bars. 2. Placing them into a crafting slot allows you to craft the diagonal version. 3. You can also rotate the texture to be either vertical or horizontal by\u00a0crouching and right clicking with an empty hand. 4. The copper bars will oxidize very quickly. To stop them from oxidizing, you must combine them with honeycomb in a crafting grid to wax them. 1. You are now able to craft chains out of iron, gold, or copper. 2. These chains will connect like fences with an additional Y dimension. They actually attach unlike vanilla chains. 3. You can also make diagonal chains by putting the chain into a crafting slot. 4. The copper chains will oxidize very fast. You can wax them by placing honeycomb above them in a crafting grid. 1. The OG Vanilla fences are now labeled \u201cOLD\u201d since they do not connect very well with the new fences. 2. The NEW fences will look like this: 3. You can make diagonal fences by placing a fence into a crafting slot. 4. You can also make \u201cVine Covered Fences\u201d by placing vines on top of fence in a crafting grid. 5. Additionally there is now a \u201cRed Nether Brick Fence\u201d. To craft red nether brick combine nether brick with nether wart. Place 2 wool above one another in a crafting grid. 1. You can craft concrete stairs and slabs with a stone cutter. 2. Or you can craft them on a crafting table. Make sure you activated the Experimental Gameplay: \u201cHoliday Creator Features\u201d, \u201cUpcoming Creator Features\u201d, and \u201cMolang Features\u201d.

            "description": "If you want more options for your fences, you might like Expanded Fences Addon (1.19) that adds two new fence variants for each wood type. You can now have fences with log or stripped log posts that match the texture of the wood. This addon is simple and vanilla friendly, and it works well with any texture pack that changes the wood textures. These new fence posts connect to many of the vanilla blocks you would expect as well as vanilla fence blocks and gates. An added perk to these fences is unlike vanilla fences, they are one block tall and are able to be jumped over by the player. Mixing and matching is 100% possible between the fences and can be used to create some pretty cool-looking animal pens. The log textures also open the possibility to create some pretty cool natural builds as well. All the crafting recipes for the fences are found within the crafting table in the game just like any other block. They follow the same recipe structure as vanilla fences just replacing the planks with either log or stripped log. Make sure you activated the Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013",

            "description": "Transform your world into a modern wonderland by constructing and designing contemporary structures such as houses, buildings, offices, bedrooms, kitchens, wardrobes, and more with the use of these innovative decorative modern blocks. Craft exquisite modern furniture with various styles, incorporate unique tile patterns with numerous variations, and pave your roads to perfection with all the necessary tools and resources! Modern Blocks Addon (1.20, 1.19) introduces over 1000 modern blocks to the game, including modern bookshelves, cabinets, drawers, tiles, and 3D block furniture. The majority of the blocks have 16 different colors, as well as wooden blocks that come in various wood types. In addition, the customizable tiles enable you to add a diverse range of patterns using Tile Pattern and much more! There are also tools in this addon used to destroy certain blocks, hence it\u2019s not yet possible to destroy custom blocks faster in survival using vanilla tools so these tools were made. Plastic Axe \u2013 used to destroy the plastic type of blocks faster Wood Saw \u2013 used to destroy the wood type of blocks faster including vanilla blocks Sledgehammer \u2013 used to destroy the stone type of blocks and tiles faster including vanilla blocks Tiles are one of the key components used in the construction industry for building interior and exterior floors, footpaths, swimming pools, walls, partitions, and roofs. There are different Tiles added in the game and each has its own unique properties, textures, and uses. There are 260 different tiles added in the game and each has a slabs type. Tiles have 16 different colors and each can add 5 different patterns, there are also other types of Tiles: Porcelain Tiles which has a rough texture good for flooring outdoor; Wooden Tile which has a wood texture; Checkered Tiles which have 16 different colors; Pool Tiles and Bathroom Tiles Here are some example builds using Tiles: This pool is made with pool tile and a pool liner on the border of the pool It looks like the more realistic pool, right? There are hundreds of blocks you can use as decoration, building structures, designing and etc. Most decorative blocks are made with liquid plastics, liquid plastic is made when crude oil is smelted in a blast furnace. Hence Chemistry Table in the game isn\u2019t craftable so you can\u2019t get crude oil in survival, so the author will add a recipe for them. The recipes are the same in the addon, the author was also created called Uncraftable. There\u2019s also an alternative way to produce liquid plastic, using Plastic Extractor you can produce it. A plastic Extractor can be used to extract liquid plastic from the ground to produce liquid plastic, it can only place on nature blocks that you can find in world layer except for ores. One of the most things liquid plastic can make are Plastic Blocks, there are different plastic blocks below. We also have furniture blocks that are used for designing interior structures such as offices, kitchens, wardrobes, schools and etc. We have 3d furniture as well which isn\u2019t only useful for decoration, but serve some functions as well, some of the blocks have functions and other will have a function soon. Are you tired of our painting as our decoration? We have a new picture frame, one is standing and the other is hanging on the wall. These picture frames have no picture yet by default, you are free to choose what pictures you can install on them. Just choose any available pictures. Here\u2019s an example built using a wooden drawer together with a picture frame and other vanilla blocks. There are blocks too that are made for kitchens such as countertops, countertops with sinks, cabinets, and drawers are included. We also have a fridge, microwave oven, cooking range, etc. which currently has no function yet, however, the water dispenser is now functional this work together with a water container, and you can learn how it works after trying it. Our modern blocks aren\u2019t complete without a decoration block for building cities, say no more to alternative blocks you use in building roads, we have a road block for that, there are different varieties of roadblocks that you could need in building city highways or roads. This isn\u2019t only about roadblocks, there are other blocks too such as caution blocks, traffic cone, and any city-related blocks. All blocks and items can be found in your creative inventory, hence they\u2019re in creative inventory in survival you can able to see them in your recipe book and thus you don\u2019t have to memorize every block\u2019s recipe. If the highlights discussion isn\u2019t enough for you, we have\u00a0Modern Blocks Guide, this is a guide that is made for this addon, it is another pack so you have to download and install it too if you need it. It modified the \u2018How to Play\u2019 UI and make it a guide. This guide provides all things you need in this addon, just read the guide and you\u2019re ready to go. Here\u2019s what it looks like.

            "description": "Attention everyone! Let\u2019s do a quick quiz. Can you name (a) Fancy and (b) Furniture? If you said \u201cFancy Furniture,\u201d you are correct! Excellent job! As a reward, you can download this Fancy Furniture Addon (1.19). In fact, everyone is welcome to download it, no matter your level of expertise. Now, let\u2019s give a warm welcome to our new salesman, Sven. He travels through birch forests with his moose, selling the best Fancy Furniture around (at least until version 4 is released). This furniture includes (and is limited to): BBQ! Yep, time for a good old backyard barbecue out on the deck. You\u00a0do\u00a0have a deck, right..? Beach Camp Stove! For when you get a case of the Munchies after swimming. TV. Two \u201cchannels\u201d! Laptop, you can\u2019t play Minecraft on it, just yet. Coffee Machine. My favorite addon to Minecraft, ever, ever, ever. Coffee is here. Milkshake Maker. Three flavors of shakes! Old-style Jukebox \u2013 built a tavern and need a\u00a0real\u00a0jukebox..? This is for you. Some great country tracks by The Caffeine Creek Band and JuliusH. Outdoor speakers, loaded with awesome tunes from Patrick de Arteaga; see patrickdearteaga.com Bar stools Reclining lounge chairs (let\u2019s be lazy) Bookshelves Pedestal fans (to keep your desert houses nice and cool) Office chairs (you want a red one, trust me) Lamps Coffee tables Sets of Drawers Washing machines Beach umbrellas and towels Sleeping bags Tents Beach Tents! Even better than normal tents, Withers can\u2019t bust into these. Sun lounges Outdoor chair Still more to come\u2026.. And his moose! Find Sven in Birch Forests and\u00a0Meadows. Bring your emeralds! You\u2019re going to need them. Most are available from your friendly local Sven. Some are also craftable. Beach Tent Craft one like this: Place the completed tent down, and it will look like this: Interact with the box and a tent will pop up (there\u2019s a variety of colors). The arrows indicate the direction the tent will be in. Interact with\u00a0the box\u00a0again and the tent will pack itself up. Destroy it and it will drop its spawn egg. Easy! Camp Stove Crafting recipe looks a lot like this: Place it down and get ready for a feast. Place in some planks and set it ablaze with a Flint and Steel. Then interact with it to \u2018cook\u2019 your food. Beach Umbrella Place it down and interact with it to expand/contract it. Comes in a variety of colors. To craft one: You can chop it up and move it (it will drop its spawn egg). Beach Towels and Sleeping Bags Beach towel crafting recipe: Place them down and interact to sit on them. No sleeping in these sleeping bags, unfortunately. We should call them sitting bags, maybe. Mona Lisa What beach trip is complete without a Mona Lisa? See if you can afford one! BBQ Light it with a flint and steel (obviously). Put it out with a flint and steel (what?). Or wait for it to turn off itself. TV Turn it on with a flint-and-steel (what?). Change the channel by interacting (two channels!). Turn it off with a flint-and-steel. Outdoor Speaker As with the jukebox, to move them, chop them up and they drop a spawn egg. To make the speakers play music, just interact with it. To stop them, same deal, just interact with it. Fan To turn it on and off, just interact with it. Jukebox To make it play, you need a Good Coin! To make a Good Coin, follow the recipe below. Once you have a Good Coin, hold it and interact with the jukebox. After a second or two, the music will start. If you want to stop the music, interact while holding redstone. If you want to move them, just chop \u2019em up and they will drop a spawn egg. Milkshake Maker Once you\u2019ve made a plain milkshake (see crafting recipes below), interact with the Maker, and you can make one of three varieties: They all have different effects. You\u2019ll always get at least health boost with a berry shake, jump boost and fire resistance with a honey shake, and speed with a chocolate shake. Coffee Machine Grab a pod (recipe below) a cup (recipe below) and a coffee machine (you\u2019ll need to find a Sven that has them in stock). You may get a variety of effects, the speed at least \u2013 just like in real life! How to brew a coffee: Milkshake Glass: Plain Milkshake (first step for flavored shakes), makes eight: Stool: Coffee Table: Coffee Pod (4): Coffee Cup: Good Coin (32): Hope you enjoy it! mcaddon: \u2013",

If you\u2019re tired of the standard vanilla doors, this addon is a must-try. It introduces more doors in a vanilla style, making it suitable for survival mode gameplay. One of the most impressive features of this addon is the variety of new doors it introduces. From stone doors to quartz doors, the addon provides a range of options that can match any architectural style you\u2019re aiming for in your Minecraft builds. The crafting process for these doors is straightforward and uses regular door patterns, making it easy to integrate into your gameplay. Another standout feature is the lock and lock pick system. This feature allows you to secure your in-game homes more effectively, adding a layer of realism and strategy to the game. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the chances of breaking in with a lock pick are low, which can be a challenge if you\u2019re on the wrong side of the door. The addon also offers compatibility with the efficient door script, allowing you to interact with two connected doors at the same time. This feature enhances the user experience and makes door interactions more intuitive. You can create new doors such as stone doors and the same quartz doors with regular door patterns or tall doors by using the crafting table You can make chiseled doors by using stonecutter: You can lock your house with a lock and break it in with your lock, but the chances are low You can use the lock by sneaking and right click on the door and hit to interact This addon also has support with an efficient door script. with the efficient door, you can interact with two connected doors at the same time Make sure you activate the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013 Kamii\u2019s Efficient Door Addon Kamii\u2019s UI Queue Addon Kamii\u2019s Script Configuration Addon \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Trial Spawner Concept Addon (1.20) implements the Trial Spawner along with other blocks announced at Minecraft Live 2023. It provides an example of how these blocks would look and function in the game. Additionally, it generates a small structure in the caves, which is a miniature version of the Trial Chambers. This addon adds: Copper Bulb, Exposed Copper Bulb, Weathered Copper Bulb, Oxidized Copper Bulb. Copper Vent, Copper grate. Tuff bricks, Tuff chiseled. Trial Spawner The objective of this addon is that they can test what is new that will be added to the game in the future and players can give an early opinion. Trial Spawner This new spawner is a little closer to what this block could be in the future. Its functionality is based on the number of players who are nearby, the minimum being 1 and the maximum being 5. The fewer players are nearby, the number of enemies will be lower, while if the maximum number of players are around, the maximum number of enemies will be generated. Once all the monsters have been generated, the Trial Spawner will drop the prize. This prize varies depending on the number of players, the more players the more prize. This prize contains diamonds and emeralds. Once the prize is awarded, the Trial Spawner will go into cooldown for several minutes, so you can leave and come back later to get more prizes. The smoke above indicates that it is in cooldown. Also, the Trial Spawner only works if it has moss or ice around it. If it has moss it indicates that slimes will be generated and if it has ice it indicates strays. If you want to try level 5 just run this command 4 times after placing the trial spawner: /tag @s remove trial_spawner The more players, the longer it takes to start. Copper Bulb The copper bulb is a lighting block, it oxidizes which means its light level will disappear. For this, you must deoxidize it with an axe or use a honeycomb to wax it. This block is generated in the new structure, you should bring an axe to see. Copper Vent The copper vent is just a decorative block Copper Grate The copper grate is a decorative block but one that allows light to pass through and see through. Tuff Bricks Tuff bricks is a new use for the tuff block. It is a great decorative block that will be generated in the trial chambers. Chiseled Tuff Bricks The chiseled tuff bricks are a decorative block that will complement the decorations with the tuff bricks. Polished Tuff The polished tuff is a decorative block that will complement the decorations with the tuff bricks and chiseled tuff bricks Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Are you a fan of the portal gun in Java? Do you want to experience it in Bedrock? With Portal Gun Addon (1.20) for Minecraft Bedrock, you can now wield the power of instantaneous travel with your very own portal gun, inspired by the legendary video game \u2018Portal\u2019. This addon brings the iconic portal gun to your Minecraft realm, allowing you to create interconnected portals that defy all the rules of physics. No more tedious treks across vast terrains \u2013 simply shoot, connect, and step through to arrive at your destination in an instant. The portal gun is quite easy to craft, and you can even get it in survival mode using vanilla Minecraft items. Added 8 new things for map makers to use, these are all uncraftable. The Cubes (block and entity) Can be picked up by portal guns Big and Small Button Small button act like a button and big button requires the player or cube to get on top of it Barrier Blocks (Only portals can go through) Portable and Non-Portable surface blocks For this to work set up a repeating command block and put \u201cfunction creator\u201d. This will make all other blocks non-portalable. Cube Dropper (Cube Tube) Once activated it will drop a cube Big Door Once unlocked it will open when a player is nearby If u want to remove these blocks you can break the block in the middle or go near them and use \u201c/event entity @e[r=2] despawn\u201d Demo Map This map will teach you how each of these new blocks works and the map has also test rooms. There are 3 different kinds of portal guns the portal model will depend on what portal gun you use. Normal Portal Gun with Book: 1x Ender Eye 6x Obsidian 2x Iron Ingot Potato Portal Gun: This portal gun has every functionality of a normal portal gun. It also plays voice lines of potato Glados. 1x Normal Portal Gun 1x Potato Rick and Morty Portal Gun: 6x Iron Ingot 2x Glass 1x Ender Eye When you craft the portal gun it will be BLUE by default when firing the portal gun it will switch to ORANGE. You can freely switch what color of the portal to shoot by\u00a0CROUCHING\u00a0and\u00a0SHOOTING\u00a0the portal gun. You can see on the portal gun what portal color it would shoot. How can I pick up blocks? Hold a portal gun in your hand (can be any color) (except for the Rick and Morty portal gun) Look directly down and shoot and it will convert your portal gun into a gravity gun. Shoot whatever blocks you want to pick up How can I place the block? Put the floating block somewhere you want to place. Use the gravity gun again to place the block. To convert it to the portal gun again shoot directly down. Shoot directly up using your portal gun. To remove the black hole switch to the blackhole portal gun again and sneak and shoot. Anything that gets close to the black hole will get sucked in and killed including you and your items. The author has also added a page on How to play for the portal gun so you can have an easy guide on how to use the portal gun and how to craft it. Settings>How To Play>Scroll to the bottom Subpacks: Has 3 settings, Portal gun + Gravity Gun, Gravity Gun Only, and Portal Gun Only.

            "description": "Elingo\u2019s World Edit Addon (1.20) is a mod that simplifies terrain building in Minecraft. The addon provides tools that allow you to add and remove terrain with just a few clicks. You can also adjust the distance, size, and shape of the terrain. Currently, the addon supports 8 different blocks that you can use to build your custom terrain. It is a great tool for those who want to build their Minecraft world with ease. These blocks can be used to build terrain: Grass Dirt Sandstone Cobblestone Stone Netherrack End Stone Air (only works in the eraser mode) The buttons and their uses: The Shape button This button changes the shape from sphere to cube, and vice versa. The Size button This button lets you decide what the size of the cube or sphere should be. The Distance button This distance changes and displays the distance between you and the object. The Mode button This button switches back and forth between these modes: Builder Mode Eraser Mode The Exit button This is the button you press when you want to disable the world editor. Usage Note: 1. When you enable the editor by entering this command \u201c/function start_editor\u201d all the items in your hotbar will be replaced with the items of this add-on, so it\u2019s recommended to have an empty hotbar before enabling the editor. 2. There will be a ball or block that shows you the center of whatever you are placing there when you hold the Builder tools or Eraser tools. 3. For the Builder tool to work, you have to make sure you\u2019ve done all of the things listed below: Hold the hammer. Right-click the hammer so that it displays \u201cHammer [On]\u201d Have the block you want to build with in the hotbar slot between the brown and red buttons. \u2013 \u2013",

Your cup will fill with coffee and then enjoy your coffee. Microwave: Interact with the microwave using raw beef. The microwave will cook it in around 3 seconds, and give you a microwaved steak, which fills 3,5 food. Toaster: First, craft sliced bread. Just make it with one normal bread on your inventory. Then, place it on the toaster. Simple toast. Ceiling Fan: The ceiling fan has a light that you can turn on by right clicking, and you can turn the fan on and off by crouching and right clicking on it. Portable Speaker: You can actually play music on it! Place it wherever you want and long-tap on it to go to the next song, or crouch and long tap on it to go to the previous one. Please note that you need to download the song packs in order to get it working. You can download them clicking here (https://minecraftworldsmaker.jimdofree.com/). The page needs some improvements so please be patient. TV (With 4 channels): The TV uses the most complex command/animation system to work. Currently since it can have bugs, it does not have a crafting recipe. But if you need it that much, just take it out of the creative inventory and place it. Can display up to 4 beautiful TV channels. Waffle Maker: Security Cameras: This new and complex security camera system will allow you to place security cameras and use them. Just place up to 20 cameras where you want, then use the camera monitor to check them. Once you are into camera mode, right click/press the next camera button to move between cameras. Jump or move to get out of the camera testing. To craft the furniture first you need an furniture table. The crafting is simple. Note: You need stainless steel ingots to craft this. Then just place the furniture table wherever you would like in your world. Now craft some blueprints to use the furniture table: Couch: Imac (Pro, Mini): Toaster: Fridge: Microwave: Coffee Maker: Gaming Chair (DXRacer, Corsair): Minebook Pro: Small Table: Ceiling Fan: JBL Flip Speaker: Waffle Maker: Once you have the blueprint for your piece of furniture just interact with the furniture table to get it. \u2013 mcaddon: \u2013",

            "description": "Creator Packs Addon (1.20) introduces 59 fresh vertical slabs into Minecraft, with each one mirroring a vanilla slab! Throughout development, efforts were made to closely align these vertical slabs with the features of their vanilla counterparts. Although certain features remain unattainable due to API limitations, they should still suffice for construction purposes. The goal is to enhance the building experience in the game by providing more versatile vertical slab options. The vanilla-cut copper slabs have many features, and I also simulated these features in the vertical slabs. These cut copper vertical slabs will oxidize (very slowly), and players can use honeycomb to prevent them from oxidizing further or use an axe to remove wax or rust. But they cannot use dispensers to wax them, nor can they be struck by lightning to remove rust. The crafting of vertical slabs is very simple, just place 3 ingredients in a vertical column in the crafting table slot, and each 3 ingredients can make 6 vertical slabs. For stone materials, you can also use a stonecutter to cut them into vertical slabs. In addition, you can also use the /function command to get vertical slabs. Each vertical slab has four orientations: east, south, west, and north, and their collision boxes are half a block in size, but due to API restrictions, blocks like torches can still be placed on top of them. Also, these vertical slabs can be waterlogged. If you add a resource pack, the textures of these vertical slabs will also change accordingly. Buildings with Vertical Slabs: Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013",

            "description": "If you are a fan of Minecraft PE, you probably know that the End is the final dimension in the game, where you can face the Ender Dragon and explore the mysterious End Cities. But you may also agree that the End is not very exciting, as it is mostly a barren wasteland of purple islands and chorus plants. Even Mojang, the developer of Minecraft, admits that the End needs some improvement. That\u2019s why a talented modder named [your name] has created Endcraft Remastered, an addon that will transform the End into a more diverse and dynamic place. Endcraft Remastered Addon (1.20) adds new biomes, structures, mobs, items, and features to the End, making it more fun and challenging to explore. The First ore is Tungsten! It is pretty common and can be used as an iron for the end! The Next Ore is Alexandrite! It is pretty much the End version of diamonds Those are all the ores for now, but soon there will be more! So stay tuned! Now we go to the Warp Logs. The Warp logs will spawn in a new End Biome and are not that special. The Leaves are called Warplight and drop Warpcane and Warpfruits, the Warpcane is like Sugar cane for the end! And now is the Wasted Cactus! This Cactus only damages you in the overworld and spawns in a new End Biome as well! And also have Stone End Sand! First is the End Wastelands It is the most common Biome and is pretty empty. It only contains 3 new Blocks and is similar to Overworld deserts! Next is the Corrupted Ends It is a pretty common Biome and is filled with new Blocks and even a new Mushroom type. It is very dark and contains a new deadly Mob which you will learn more of later Last but not least is the\u00a0Warp Ends It is pretty rare and contains a lot of blocks It is very big as well First is the End Slime, a pretty annoying mob that drops slime. Spawns all around the end! Second of all is the shulk. It is pretty much the wish.com version of a Slime and a shulker. Next is the\u00a0Warpman! It is a new and Stronger Enderman which drops a better Ender Pearl! Last is the\u00a0Corruptmite. It is very strong and only spawns in the Corrupted Ends. If you see it, run We have the Chalked Endstone, which is pretty much the cobblestone for the End We also have End Caves! Beware of the traps! And that is about it! Hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for more! Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

Decorpack Craft Addon (1.21, 1.20) introduces over 207 craftable block types, including sleek panels, elegant columns, versatile stair blocks, and the innovative cladding block that enhances your building\u2019s exterior without altering the interior design. In order to get the blocks in Survival mode, you must bring a stone cutter and a stone and insert the stone into the stone cutter and it will show you all the blocks. The cladding block helps you change the external appearance of the building. For example, you want to build a room from the inside in red, but it will appear to the building in its external appearance and spoil the matter. However, with the cladding block, you will hide the external appearance in a smaller area than the regular block. Many blocks will be added in the upcoming updates. Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013",

            "description": "Are you looking for a way to make Minecraft\u2019s biomes more detailed? Do you want to add tons of new decorative and functional blocks? How about new animals to populate the world? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Wilder World is the addon for you! And even if you didn\u2019t answer yes, keep reading, you might still like what you see! Wilder World Addon (1.21, 1.20) is an addon that enhances existing biomes in the game by adding new generations, blocks, and mobs. Its main focus is on the Desert, Savanna, Badlands, and Jungle biomes, but many other biomes like the forests, swamps, and birch forests receive updates too! The addon introduces 5 new wood types, such as Azalea Wood, Palm Wood, and Willow Wood. Additionally, there are 10 new animals, 150+ blocks, and over 30 new items. While we cannot go into extensive detail about everything here, we can briefly show off the main features of the 4 focus biomes. There is so much content in this addon, that we strongly advise using the recipe book to see what\u2019s new to craft (or just use the creative inventory). Deserts: The Main new features of the deserts are the new palm trees, one of the 5 new wood types, there are also new sand/sandstone blocks, and new types of grass and flowers, such as marram grass or small cacti, which drop fruit. Camels can also now be found anywhere in deserts. There are also 3 new animals! Meerkats love to interact with you, but don\u2019t disturb them while they are asleep! If you feed one a spider\u2019s eye, it might just give you something in return. Fennec Foxes are simple desert mobs, you can feed them prickly pears, and they may sleep underneath desert palms. Rattlesnakes are very dangerous if attacked, but when not angry, can shed their scales in the morning, letting you craft a poison-resistant chest plate or decorative blocks. Savannas: Savannas now include many new blocks, such as Dry and Wet Mud, dry mud can even make the new adobe bricks block! You can also find Baobab Trees, which have their very own wood type, keep in mind that to grow them you just place 9 saplings in a square. You can also find termites, which will feast on log blocks placed near their mounds, converting them into more termite nests, and allowing you to farm their drops. Savannas now also houses two unique mobs! Cheetahs love to hunt, attacking Ostriches and Chickens, and anything that attacks them first, they are incredibly quick, and you can feed them raw poultry to breed them. Ostriches can be bred with seeds, and drop a unique meat type when killed, they love to stick their heads in the ground, and when their eggs hatch, their shells can be brewed into a potion of resistance! Badlands: Badlands now feature the unique \u2018Flowering Cactus\u2019 which can be mined for lots of prickly pears, you can also find thorny roots which are dangerous to step through and tumbleweed stems, which can grow tumbleweeds for use as an item or through a dispenser! Additionally, all sand variants from the desert section carry over to red sand, you can also now make bricks out of terracotta! Make sure to watch out for tumbleweeds as they barrel through the badlands damaging anything in their way, a good punch will knock them over and render them useless! The Badlands also has 2 new mobs to see! Vultures love to inhabit the skies, flying circles and slyly following players, could it be a bad omen? Scorpions are quite dangerous, they come out at night and try and poison you, but their dropped poison sac can be used to make potions of decay! Jungles: Jungles now feature a lot of new plant life and blocks, for example, moss can be found on the surface, and mossy cobblestone can be found underground! you will also find more redstone ore in this biome Trees are far more common and larger than before, better emulating real-life rainforests, you can also find a new type of tree, the Banana Tree, which can drop bananas from its leaves! Other plants exist, like the luminous wild root, a descendant of the ancient pitcher plant Of course, new animals exist too! Poison Dart Frogs can be found in jungles, they can poison you when taking damage, but if fed a small magma cube they produce a unique froglight block based on their colour. Butterflies also spawn in any kind of jungle, they like flowers but mainly serve as ambient mobs. The Vanilla froglights are above, the new poison dart frog ones are below. The others: New Blocks of sugarcane and paper; Mushrooms mounted on the trees of roofed and birch forests! Fireflies and willow trees in the updated swamps, Cattails, Lavenders and many rose bushes.. 2 New Stone Types! Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. mcaddon: \u2013 mcaddon: \u2013",

If you\u2019re a fan of sailing the high seas or exploring new waters, then this add-on will provide a remarkable experience. This add-on introduces a detailed and aesthetically pleasing ship into the Minecraft world. The ship is not just a static entity but a fully explorable and functional vessel complete with various sections such as the deck, cabins, and the helm. The intricacy of the ship\u2019s design and the care taken in detailing the interiors are quite impressive, adding a whole new layer of realism and immersion to the game.

All unconnected blocks will be skipped and left hanging. Sneak of jump to unmount the ship When unmounting the ship will automatically rotate according to its nearest angle facing (north, east, south, or west) Adding a floating point will control how deep the boat will submerge. You may add multiple Floating points but at least one is somewhere below the ship\u2019s wheel. Make sure you turn on the Experimental Gameplay. \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013",
